Through logging my food, educating myself about proper nutrition and becoming more active I have went from a dress size 14 to 2, without starving myself, without hours and hours on end of working out.  I started my get-fit journey in January of 2011. I have had my share of failures, of falling down, of wanting to give up... But I kept asking myself- how bad do I really want this?? And the answer was always BAD. So I kept pushing on.  I swear by the combo of moderate/intense cardio and weight lifting. WEIGHTS WILL NOT BULK YOU UP LADIES! The more lean muscle you have, the more calories you burn- even at rest.   I suffered from severe social anxiety when I first started, so the first half of my progress was done at home using various videos (favorites being Turbo Fire and ChaLean Extreme). I got bored, my progress stalled.. I needed a change. So I put my big girl panties on, went on a free trial at my gym, and fell in love. There's nothing like the feel of accomplishment and baddassery you get from lifting weights. It made me stronger, both inside and out. I still have anxiety, but it's not nearly as bad. I feel like a different person now! So much so that I decided to pursue a career in the fitness industry as a personal trainer and am now working at the very same gym where I faced my fears.","To be one of those trainers who you can look at and say ""She knows what she is doing!""

If you aren't one of those,  just drop me a line, when requesting the add  ;-)  I try to keep up as best as I can around here, but most of my time is spent in the backend of EM2WL.com, Periscope/Twitter @EM2WL or Instagram - @eatmore2weighless.  So if I seem quiet, just pop in one of those and say hi!  I'm a happily married, homeschooling, Christian wife/mother.  I work out from home - I started out using mainly DVDs by Cathe Friedrich (Cathe.com)!  I'm a Certified Personal Trainer (Master Trainer, or ""trainers trainer"") & love lifting weights and lifting HEAVY, and typically encourage my MFP friends to do the same. I do not concern myself with getting ""too bulky"", because I know that lifting heavy does not do this...eating too much food DOES.  My training philosophy is to eat enough food, to gain enough muscle, so that I can eat more food (I adore eating, love good tasty food).  I do cardio if/when necessary, but I do not rely on it to do the job that can be done with proper eating.  I also don't believe in starving myself to achieve results, my food philosophy is the same as my cardio mindset.  I eat to support the phase that I'm in (building muscle=higher cals, losing fat = lower cals, or maintaining), all the while making healthy choices whenever possible, but still enjoying life. I believe that no matter what a woman's goals are, weights should be included (even if they choose to do more cardio than I, personally, prefer.)  **If you are not an EM2WL member - CHECK OUT THE  EAT MORE 2 WEIGH LESS SITE, TO UNDERSTAND MY EATING PHILOSOPHY**  eatmore2weighless.com (or EM2WL.com)  I'll fully admit, I state my opinion even when it's not asked for, but I'm working on getting better at that :-).

I love working out, being healthy, and spreading the news that you don't have to starve to lose.     04/2011 - My story of how I finally started fueling instead of starving my body....I spent about 8 months trying to lose the last 20lbs....eating from 1200, then went to 1350 and then 1500 and bounced up and down 3lbs...whined, cried, complained...you name it.  Then one day, I read an excerpt from ""New Rules of Lifting Weights for Women"" and it totally broke down why eating less and exercising more reeks havoc on our bodies...why I was then in starvation mode and wasn't losing weight.  So based on the information I raised my non-workout caloric intake to 1800 and on my workout days I eat a minimum of 2000 but have gone as high as 2500.  I have one cheat day on the weekend where I don't track.  It broke down why CARBS ARE IMPORTANT AND PROTEIN TOO...and I adopted the 40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat ratios.  I eat no less than 30gr of fiber a day.  I always drink a protein shake after every workout.    I now lift way heavier, never feel hungry or deprived, I stopped carb binging, and what I have started doing is losing fat, gaining muscle, have lost inches and the fat loss is pretty steady.  So, I am a huge proponent of EATING MORE to WEIGH LESS.    Update 12/06/2014- Long story since posting the above...I was side blended with so many stressors in my life and battled adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues, gained 20lbs, ate at maintenance for a over a year...today I am wearing size 8 slacks and skirts, size 8/10 jeans, and medium shirts at approx 169lbs. I've built quite a bit of muscle (along with the fat) and for the last month I've been on a slight cut of 250 cals eating anywhere from 2000 cals to 2900.  I've really seen great improvement recently and others are noticing too.  My focus and goals have changed so much over the last few years.  I'm no longer scale dependent, and love pushing the limits and PRing in the weight room.

Back in my early 30s I went from probably the 190s (I didn't weigh myself until I was down some from my high) to 120 and maintained at about 125 for several years, in large part due to lots of cardio, especially triathlon training.

My main goals are to keep up accountability.  Even (or especially) logging those ""bad"" days.    Update 8/16/15:  Reflections on one year using myfitnesspal. I started out not even sure if this weight loss thing was realistic for me, but I knew that I had to change. Life as I was living it was not working, my health was at risk and I was disengaged in a lot of ways from life. In the past year, I've lost 58 lbs, regained about 8 lbs and been up and down a bit, now about 3 lbs away from my lowest. I stopped binge eating for over 6 months, then started to overeat again,but able to over and over return to my new habits. I went from semi-disability with chronic plantar fasciitis to truly a dancer and just this very weekend I danced over 20k steps in one day. More than anything, I've learned to put myself out there, be vulnerable in friendships and romantic relationships, ask for what I want, stand strong in the knowledge that I have my own back and can handle what comes my way. I've got another 58 lbs or so to lose. My triglycerides are still too high, and I want to increase my HDL even more. Over the next year I want to keep doing the work, cook more, get more fiber, adopt even more activity into my life including becoming a bicycle commuter, lose at least 27 lbs, and keep on making strides in building a satisfying personal and professional life.  Update 4/17/15:  I achieved my second major weight goal today of getting under 200.  My weight loss was much less linear over the past several months, with trips home, surgery, injury, and just plain ole overeating.  However, I kept going, and I actually feel great that I worked through challenges and slips, because it gives me the confidence that I'm not going to give up and I know how to get back on track!  Update 10/6/14:  I achieved my first major weight goal today of getting under 230, which is also exceeding 10% weight loss from my starting weight.

Up five pounds, but back to logging.  5/2/2015 I use a fitbit and my calculations tell me that fitbit overestimates my calorie burn by 250 to 400 calories per day. Net calories is, therefore, not accurate. I have been losing about 1.7 pounds per week since January.    Due to insulin resistance I am watching my carbohydrate intake. My doctor supports a diet that is lower is carbs and higher in healthy fats and protein for weight loss and blood sugar management. She believes the insulin resistance will resolve with weight loss. I usually eat fewer than 100 grams of carbs per day. I also find that I don't get as hungry when I eat fewer carbs.  I have been using a JumpSport trampoline to get in steps in the evening.

Marcus and Piers both have autism and Piers also has ADHD. I work full time as a midwife. I love running and lifting weights in equal measures.  I also enjoy dancing and attend a mixed styles and streetdance class for 2 hours a week. I am married to Miles who is into lifting on and off (currently in an on phase). We have  converted our dining room into a gym.  I follow a paleo lifestyle as I just feel healthier that way.,"I realised I needed to get fitter when Piers ran off in the  street and I couldn,t catch him. He nearly got run over, I started running the next day and havn,t stopped.  I have also spent the vast majority of my 30s overweight, wearing frumpy clothes and feeling uncomfortable I willl not spend my 40s like this. I also want to be a good role model to my kids eating healthily and living cleanly.    Update  Since writing this I have regained a little weight but back on track getting it off again. I gained weight because I developed some health issues. I have fibromyalgia which causes me pain in my muscles and causes fatigue. I was also diagnosed with a meningioma brain tumour thankfully small and benign but all the same it's there. This was a wake up call. I need to be the best version of me I can and I will not give in to illness. My family need me around for a long time yet. Following the paleo diet helps me deal with my health issues when I follow the diet I have more energy and less pain. After a brief return to conventional style eating I realise paleo is the only way for me to eat for optimal health.","My husband and children; The person who most inspires me is PINK.; All my MFP friends you inspire me in so many ways, thanks.",226

Yeah, I actually enjoy it now that it's become part of my lifestyle.  :)  I'm 5' 8"" tall.  Milestones, accomplishments and  goals are all recorded below.  :)  I'm a Road Mapper!  Best success I've had has been since I started eating according to the info and tools in this topic:  http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/974888/in-place-of-a-road-map-2k13  Well worth reading, understanding, and following!  FOOD IS FUEL AND KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!  Most of us can't get by on the standard 1200 cals per day, especially with exercise.  I follow the Road Map found here:  http://www.myfitnesspal.com/topics/show/912914-in-place-of-a-road-map-3-2013 With the tools and info in that thread, I found my BMR and my TDEE and I eat in between those numbers.  I'm focused on losing fat & keeping lean muscle, not necessarily losing weight at this point - I want to lower my body fat percentage.  I took my TDEE and subtracted 15% from it to get my daily goal.  Since my exercise is figured into the TDEE based on my activity level, I don't eat my exercise calories back UNLESS I'm hungry or if my NET for the day is below my BMR of around 1400 - I never net below my BMR!  Since following this plan, I have lost fat and inches and dropped another pants size.    Taking measurements and photos is key!  Results don't always show on the scale!  History:  In 2009 I realized I didn't like what I was seeing in photos of me - arms were getting thicker, legs were chunkier & I was buying larger sized pants & shorts.  I had been slowly gaining a few pounds every year, and it was time to do something about it.  Stepped on the scale and I was 162lbs - the heaviest I'd ever been.    I started walking daily, 2-3 miles at a time, but wasn't seeing any results.  I knew I had to do more than just walk.  Someone told me about online fitness tracking programs, so I found one, signed up & started logging my foods & exercise.  I wanted new exercise plans, so I started with 30 Day Shred, and with changing what I ate - tracking was a real eye-opener to the crapola I had been eating.  Too much junk & not nearly enough protein.    My first goal was to get down to 155lbs.  I achieved it, and reset my goal to 150.  I hit it again and had to buy new clothes.  Yay!  Then it was 145 - done!  Somewhere in there I found MFP and loved it!  Hit a few bumps along the way, and fluctuated weight and in August of 2011, I was back up over 150.  I hadn't been logging foods or exercising regularly, so when my kid started school, I got back to routine.  It was a few months after this that I found the In Place Of A Road Map thread and upped my calories.  As of 5/1/12 I'm 140lbs!  My goal is 138 and will reevaluate from there.  UPDATE:  Made it to 137.8 at the end of May, re-ran my numbers through fat2fit again and still want to lower my body fat%.  New weight goal is 135lbs.  UPDATE:  Hit 136.3 on 7/29/12!!  UPDATE:  11/14/12  Weight has been bouncing between 137 and 139 for months now, however my clothes are still fitting more loosely, and measurements are showing that the fat is still coming off - proof that the scale is not always the best judge of progress!    UPDATE:  136 lbs on 2/2/13  *NOTE* Only a .3lb loss on the scale between July of '12 and Feb. of '13, but dropped a full pants size, lost inches and fat during this time!  Take measurements, don't trust the scale!  :)  ***GOAL!! 134.6lbs on 2/11/13  ****  2/25/12 - Upped calories to 1950  UPDATE:  133.8 lbs on 3/2/12!!  I typically workout 5-6 days a week, at home.  I use the Nike Training Club app on my iPhone with dumbbells, a kettlebell, medicine ball and my own body weight.  It's FREE and it's awesome!!  I've been working my way through all of the workouts, and love that they are from 15 minutes to 45 minutes in length.  Mostly I use the 15 minute workouts in the Get Focused section, doing two a day, like arms & back, or legs & butt, etc.  Update - since January of 2014 I've started using workouts from FitnessBlender.com - another awesome and FREE source for great workouts.  Great variety - strength, yoga, pilates, cardio, and blends of all of them - good stuff, check it out.  Finished the c25k program at the end of March, 2012 - went from being a non-runner to running a 5k!  The program works - try it!   Now I typically run 3 days a week, mixing it up with a longer distance, a shorter interval run for speed, and a basic 3 or 4 miler each week.  Longest run to date is 8 miles, have done 7 a couple of times.  I enjoy the shorter distances more, and am starting to focus on shorter runs with speed intervals.  Added the Zombies, Run! app a few months back for more fun and structured interval running - nothing motivates a burst of speed like the sound of zombies in your headphones!","Want to feel great and be healthy!

I have been overweight since high school and I have been trying ti get it under control for years, but now it is about my health and it is time to get serious. I know I am facing health complications if I keep going like this and I do not want to end up in the hospital or have to take medicine to control my BP. My problem is that when I am bored or stressed I want to eat sweets to help me calm down, and I need to find something that I can do to replace that.   I got my bachelors degree in psychology, and I am currently working on a masters in special education. I want to be a special education teacher for elementary students.  I just got married two years ago. My husband is a preschool teacher right now, but he is working on his masters degree in secondary education, and he wants to teach high school English. We have a 8 year old dog named Princess that we adopted in 2010.  I have tried other diets before, some more successful than others. In high school I did WW and lost 15 pounds, but then I got diagnosed with depression and hypothyroidism, which contributed to my weight gain. I have gained about 100 pounds since I was a sophomore in high school at a healthy weight of about 150. I would like to be back there someday. Recently, I did Jenny Craig and was successful for awhile, but I just couldn't stick to it because I always felt hungry. This summer (2013,) I decided to start researching weight loss surgery.

Really helps that I workout with my boss after work. June: I did work out 5-6 days a week (closer to 5) . Didn't lose much (like, a lb, lol). Did some things around the house, not enough. I DID go outside quite a bit, which makes me happy. =p July: I haven't even finished the first week of c25k. I want to do it in the mornings....still working on that, haha. I did other things like...play in the garden, and attempt riding my bike that I got (I can't go very far yet XD). I did go up on my squats! Did not go up on bench press.

One can only binge watch on Netflix and eat Ben & Jerry's for so long before they realize it's time for a change.  I thought that this site could motivate me to further achieve my goals. I have a thing for procrastinating as well as losing habit so this should help! My goal is to tone my body and get rid of all my chubbiness.

I eat about 1700 calories a day to lose weight (a deficit of about 400 calories) and I lose about 3 lbs a month on average  -In January 2014, I started lifting heavy 3x a week, and I love it. My exercise program now consists mostly of lifting 3x a week, running 2x a week, walking my dogs every day, and biking 6-10 miles at a time. When the weather is good, I like to spend a lot of time being active outdoors.  -I had a fairly easy time maintaining my weight for 6 months at about 150 pounds before becoming pregnant in March. It turns out that 150 pounds at a size 6/8 is my happy place, and when I'm fit at that size, my body can do everything I want it to do. My plan for this pregnancy is to stay as fit as possible and gain weight in a healthy way so that I can get back to my normal eating and exercising routine once the baby comes. =o)  I am a vegetarian for personal reasons. Still, I aim to eat at least 80 grams of protein a day. My macro percentages are set at 45C, 30F, 25P. I hope to work my way to 40-30-30.   MY FOOD PHILOSOPHY   Although I do strive to a eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of whole foods,I am not a ""clean"" eater. I love food as a means to fuel my body, but I also love food as one of many ways to enjoy life. I believe in eating now the way I want to eat for the rest of my life, which includes natural foods, fruits and veggies as well as pizza, ice cream, beer, or whatever else I might feel like. I do try to work these things into my calorie goals, and I pay attention to my macros to keep an eye on my nutrition, but if I go over a little bit here and there, I don't beat myself up about it. I think the best course of action for long-term success is to eat as much as possible to reach my goals, not as little as possible. I don't believe in depriving myself or feeling guilty about something I've eaten. For me, moderation is key.","This is my first genuine attempt to lose weight and get healthy. For the most part I was always okay with my body. However, over time, my weight crept up on me. I didn't realize how overweight I had become until I randomly decided to weigh myself at the beginning of January 2013. That number, plus a terrible picture of myself from that Christmas (it's in my photos if you want to have a look!) fueled me to change, and I haven't looked back!  Before I started this journey in January 2013, my knees were constantly sore. I lived a very sedentary life and became out of breath easily. I felt physically uncomfortable, and I was starting to feel like the way I looked on the outside didn't match how I felt on the inside.   I want to be in control of my body instead of my body being in control of me. I want to feel fit, strong, and capable of doing anything, and I want to make sure I have a healthy body when I decide to start having children.

Below is a little bit about me and how I got here.*  I used to have this long story about how I got fat posted on here.  I decided that anything longer that ""I ate too much and didn't exercise"" was too long.  So, that's been changed.  I did start out losing weight thinking breakfast was the most important meal of the day, that I had to eat 6 meals to keep the metabolic fires burning, that I had to cut out ""dessert"" type foods, that I couldn't eat late in the evening, that I had to do long bouts of cardio to effectively burn fat, etc, etc. While none of these habits are harmful, they aren't necessary.  I've since learned that I can eat whenever and whatever I choose as long as I meet my daily macro/micro intake and stay at a deficit if I'm trying to cut body fat.  I've learned that I don't like long bouts of cardio and that I enjoy lifting really heavy things.

I did not go on a diet, and I didn't do anything I wasn't willing to do for the rest of my life.  Fat dropped steadily, and my fitness and energy levels skyrocketed.  When I hit my goal weight, the only change I made was eat a little more.   I have been maintaining my weight loss (within a 5 pound range) since September of 2012.  I do this with a ""clean week, dirty weekend"" method.  I stick to around 2,000 calories on weekdays, regardless of exercise, and eat (and, umm, drink) whatever I like on the weekends without tracking it.  So far it's working well.  I'll adjust if it stops.  I exercise 5-6 days a week.  I lift weights 2-4 days a week.  On cardio days, I take classes at the gym or run.

After a holiday with the girls (drinking every night, and overindulging to the max) I finally jumped on the scales and saw 73kg looking back at me, I was pretty shocked how much I let myself go. The same day I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started counting calories, I also read through the forums and starting educating myself on nutrition.   The quote that changed my thinking was “it takes 4 weeks for you to notice, 8 weeks for your friends to notice, and 12 weeks for everyone else to notice” I had always given up after about two weeks, so this motivated me to keep going. This quote proved true, literally to the day! On my 12th week a colleague stopped me in the hall and said “have you lost weight?!” and I could not stop smiling. After about a year (with a few “breaks”) I lost 10kg.   I was struggling to lose the last few kilos and saw a naturopath who encouraged me to try low carb dieting and that helped me lose an additional 3kg. I would still like to lose about 5kg and consider low carb my new way of eating rather than a diet.",To feel better and look better,My skinny Mum; To feel comfortable,132

6871,nill4me,48.0,Female,"Hollywood, SC",Hollywood,SC,Road Warrior,"ERP / IT Consultant.  On the road constantly, so I've been trying to find ways to bring a more healthy lifestyle on the road with me such as:  staying in hotels with a fridge/kitchenette so i can get my own fresh food, bringing copies of my zumba dvds with me on the road so i can work out doing something other waiting in line for the crappy hotel treadmill, going to bed at a decent hour, etc.  Lost my gallbladder after attempting a PSMF way of eating (Protein Sparing Modified Fast - read:  Super low fat starvation diet).  I was tired and cranky all the time...not to mention a zombie.  This was my own fault, as I took this diet to an extreme - borderline eating disorder.  Lesson learned...quite the price to pay.  I've become hypersensitive to carbohydrate and now avoid it like the black plague of death that it is, by adopting a nutritional ketosis way of eating.  It has allowed me to unchain and liberate myself from multiple meals per day.  I remain satisfied and focused, and I get to eat bacon.  I am wanting to eventually adopt a paleo / primal way of eating, but I need to really get this glucose under control, and the diet restrictions of keto help me stay cognizant at all times.  The introduction of Intermittent Fasting has been an eye opening experience for me in terms of both self-control and planned/timed cognizant food choice.  I was recently diagnosed with Mastocytosis (2014), so now I'm trying to figure out what the hell it is and what to do about it.    Every decision you make has an impact on your life and on the lives of those around you.  No one is in this alone.  I set an arbitrary goal weight o 145/150 - within the healthy weight range.  Actual final weight will be determined by overall health factors.  It might be more it might be less.  So thats 105lbs to lose.  egad.  Mini Milestones: 5% of goal weight lost - Reached July 2014 (250.23) 10% of goal weight lost - Reached - August 2014 (244.95) 25% of goal weight lost - Reached February 2015 (229.13) 50% of goal weight lost - 4.85 lbs to go  (202.75) 75% of goal weight lost - 31.22 lbs to go  (176.38) Final goal weight 57.6 lbs to go.   (150)  Why do I take all those supplements?  Quercetin with Bromelain - for mast cell stabilization - it is a natural bioflavonoid to help inhibit histamine release.  Helps with my mast cell disease.  L-carnitine - To assist / aid in overall mitochondrial function - which has probably been damaged along with everything else  Choline and inositol - To help with fat breakdown, cholesterol, and diabetic neuropathy - also to keep the brain sharp.  Rhodiola Rosea - To help with mood/stress - hopefully to keep that cortisol where it belongs.  Krill Oil - studies are showing it is more beneficial than commercial fish oil.    Studying the benefits of PQQ - to see if it has the potential to actual regenerate mitochondira- more to follow on that!  Meds: Synthroid - Hashimoto's chronic thyroiditis (autoimmune) Metformin - T2 autoimmune diabetes Gabapentin - I get twitchy - restless legs - this helps.

Doing just one thing is not enough to keep me engaged.... maybe one exception to that rule, but I have a different social media site for that.  :P    If I am not consumed with what I am doing, I am usually distracted by whatever the current stress causing item is or thinking about food.  What are we doing for dinner?  What am I going to order for lunch?  Is it bad that we only like about 10 veggies?  What else can I throw in the mix when I get a chance to cook?  Why does food that is good for you taste so bad that I would rather not eat at all?  I wonder if the kids are even going to eat tonight?  Will I have the energy after work to cook a whole meal or will I be feeding them fish sticks?  And welcome to the ramblings, concerns and paranoia that consumes my head.

I successfully lost about 25 lbs using MFP a few years back. Then I stopped logging my food & exercising and ended up gaining it all back and then some. What this has taught me is that I'll probably need to continue logging forever but that's ok! Once I lose this weight my plan is to keep it off and not have to go through this again!  I don't do any type of diet (been there, done that - they don't last). I refuse to cut out anything as I find that not to be something I can sustain long-term. I eat all foods/drinks within my daily calorie goal. I will admit I go over sometimes but life happens. I have committed myself to logging EVERYTHING - even the really ugly days - because otherwise I am only lying to myself.   I have finally come to the realization that weight loss is not linear. I weigh in every day because I find that helps keeps me on track and makes it easier to see the progression based on a weekly average. The number might be up 1-2 lbs over the previous day but I log it anyway. More often than not, it's gone in the next day or 2. As long as I continue to see a downward trend, I'm happy. It's taken me a long time to learn and accept this! But it makes weight loss a lot less stressful in my opinion.  My exercise of choice is running. I started out in 2011 using the Couch 2 5K app and I was so out of shape I could barely make it through the 60 second running intervals!! I hated it. However I pushed through, completed the program, moved on to the 10K program, and then decided to sign up and train for a half marathon. I ran my first one in April 2012 and have since run a total of 8! I have 2 more planned this Fall (September/October 2015) and probably many more in the future.

I've been gradually gaining weight over the years but recently decided that enough is enough.  I was tired of being tired, and tired of the aches and pains associated with being morbidly obese.  Plus I am a Type 2 Diabetic and the doctor said I would be injecting insulin soon if I didn't get things under control.  So about 100 days ago I got my act together and tapped in to all that MFP has to offer.  I've learned that sticking with things on MFP really does make a difference!  I have a ways to go, but I love how much better I already feel!  Update 8/4/2015 - So in the past 8 month I have been through the ringer.  I got laid off from a job I loved and I let that sidetrack me.  In the past few weeks I decided I had to get back on track and am back at it.  Unfortunately I have to lose weight I already lost.

I'm a video editor/graphic designer full time, and do other video production, photography, and general multimedia funzies for freelance work on the side. Basically all I do is work, eat, and lift.  I started my journey at the beginning of April 2014 at 210 lbs in size 14 jeans.   STATS: Height: 5'5"" SW: 210 CW: around 160 (+/- 3lbs), size 6 or 8 jeans, sometimes 4, who the hell knows GW: 150? 140? Idk, whatever happens happens  PRs (5 reps) Squat: 155lbs Bench: 82.5lbs Overhead Press: 60lbs Row: 87.5lbs Deadlift: 195lbs   I carb cycle and roughly follow the Targeted Ketogenic Diet, consuming ~50g carbs the meal before my workout. Other days are approximately 30-40 net carbs but I'm not intensely strict. I also (sometimes) have a high carb refeed day every Monday. I love the low carb lifestyle because it's all my favorite foods, and carbs make me feel yucky.  I'm in the midst of slowly reverse dieting to maintenance in hopes of repairing my metabolism which basically crashed and burned after a year and a half of a deficit. I didn't want to lower my calories any more, so instead I'm refreshing my metabolic rate. In December I start cutting on keto for my wedding in March.  I LOVE heavy lifting. I started Stronglifts 5x5 in December 2014 and started Madcow (intermediate version) in July 2015. I go for a walk in my office park every day on lunch, (or in the company gym if it's raining). On my non-lift days I bike, walk, or stationary bike if I get rained out. I'm one of those freaks who enjoys both lifting and cardio. :)  --------------------------------- Current goals:  [  ] Waist measurement under 30"" [  ] Find my 1RMs [  ] Set 5 rep squat PR [  ] Set 5 rep deadlift PR [  ] Deadlift 200lbs for reps [  ] Deadlift 250lbs [  ] Bench 100lbs [  ] OHP 90lbs [  ] Eat a dozen eggs in one sitting  -------------------------------- Past goals:  [X] Purchase and wear my first bikini to the beach in September??

I thought your body composition was first determined by genetics, second determined by activity level, and third by food intake, so I didn't bother trying to improve food or exercise. I thought I was just doomed to be overweight.  I reached a breaking point in March 2014 and through a lot of research learned about calorie deficits and the proper, healthy way to lose weight. A year and a half later, I'm a completely different person and there is no going back. I constantly educate myself on nutrition and choose the best foods to fuel my body. I love to exercise now and have fallen madly in love with heavy lifting, constantly being driven by my own goals to increase my strength.  My original goal with all this was to not have to buy a plus size wedding dress. I'm excited to report that I did buy my dress and it was NOT plus size! Woohoo!  I LOVE to cook in a way I can hardly describe. I cook 99% of what I eat and I try new recipes all the time. A great majority of what I eat is considered ""clean eating"" but I'm not 100% strict and find room for the occasional treat. Moderation is key!","- I want to be an inspiration to those around me as proof that changing small things about your eating and activity habits can have huge results  - Build muscle and be strong  - I have a desk job and I don't want my weight to spiral out of control.

After something tragic and lifechanging event happens, perfection in fitness really isn't that important to me anymore. I no longer want to compete with others or myself, I just want to be healthy and active and doing things I enjoy. Being in nature is therapeutic for me, so probably be more focused on hikes, walks and bike rides from now on, and I don't care about calories burned, HRM's or if I stayed within my calorie limits. I will continue to log if it helps inspire someone to follow a healthier lifestyle, but it really seems so minute in the grand scheme of things. I just want to slow down so I can hear the birds chirp, enjoy the sun on my skin, feel the breeze blow thru and see the scenery in present moment.   Instead of having a near death experience, I have had a near life experience in which a veil has been lifted and I will forever look at life differently.  I have some injuries that require surgery, yet not been able to take the time off or financial time off at this time in my life, so I mainly do things modified.  I may  not work out to the intensity I used to, just have to do it longer time wise.    I follow an 80/20 rule for my diet of eating healthy 80%, 20% I eat and enjoy treats in life, being mindful and truly savoring each bite.     I'm a foodie! I have a passion for cooking it, eating it, reading all about it, but especially food in it's most natural state. You won't find this girl eating Lean Cuisine lunches, or Jenny Craig dinners, or anything claiming to be low fat, cause there is usually a hidden evil you are trading in place.    I also IF and zig zag with my calories, so don't be alarmed if one day it's super low, there will be another day when it's high.  I just found by doing it one or two days a week, it seems to work for me, especially in feeling better and more energetic in raising my metabolism.   I believe in having a healthy relationship with my food, not a battle against it.  Food=Fuel.  ╰☆╮Feel free to add me as a friend!

With that out of the way… I started this thing in June 2010. I lost over 40 lb since then. But then everything came to a screeching halt.  I'm injured. One of my injuries is getting better, very slowly. The other will never get better and I have to learn to compensate. Things aren't so easy for me right now but I'm trying to claw my way up from the bottom. I've regained most of what I lost.   I was lifting heavy weights 3-4 days a week doing Wendler's 5/3/1. But I'm experiencing some joint pain related to a genetic condition (details below) and have to give that up. Hopefully I'll find a workaround. I want to be a superhero.  I want to do all the things.   I'm an Emergency Veterinary Technician and I work 12 hour overnight shifts fulltime and I also work part time during the day. I'm the supervisor at my fulltime job. For the most part, my only internet access is through my phone. Keeping up can be a little difficult for me especially since I work so much.   I've been in the goth/neo-victorian/deathrock/postpunk scene for the majority of my life. It's just part of me at this point and it's who I am.   I'm also an artist. But life has gotten in the way of that. I am very aware that it is next to impossible to make a living off your art. You can view some of my past artwork here:   http://www.myfitnesspal.com/blog/elisabat/view/my-artwork-nsfw-boobies-215973   In person, I am very shy and quiet. I've always been this way and it's not going to change. I do have a very cynical and sarcastic sense of humor and I prefer that most of my friends do as well. I also use foul language and big words on a regular basis. If you are easily offended, just make it easier on both of us and don't request me.   I should also probably state that I really have no interest in flirting online. I don't care that others do, just don't expect me to.   I’ve got this thing about corsets and fashion history. I like pretty things. I also like mythology. Celtic and Egyptian being my favorites. Research is fun.","I am not on a ""journey"". That just sounds hippy-ish and new agey. And journeys always end.   I am simply trying to better my life. I have a very rare genetic bone disease called Congenital Multiple Osteochondromatosis or Multiple Hereditary Exostoses. It's so special it has 2 names. Basically what that means is that I have bone and cartilage tumors on every joint of my body except for my head. I've been told my case is more severe than most. Most people afflicted only have 1 or 2 tumors. In my teens and 20's I had multiple orthopedic surgeries which left me very debilitated. There was a point, I'm not sure when, that I decided not to be victimized by my bones anymore. I just decided screw it, I'm going to live my life like a normal person. I'm still in pain but I manage to ignore it because basically it's been like this all my life. I know nothing different.  In 2007, my mother died of cancer. I gave up my life in San Francisco and moved to the east coast to take care of her. It was the single hardest thing I've ever done. I'd do it again in a heartbeat though. Since then, I've felt as if I've failed her. Since she died, my life has gotten no better. Losing weight and getting healthy is something I'm dedicating to her memory. She would be proud of me and that's worth it.  I'm homesick for San Francisco. I've lived there most of my life and everything I know and everyone I know is there.

708,avskk,30.0,Female,"Portales, NM",Portales,NM,,"In May of 2013 I was an almost completely sedentary person with 100lbs of excess weight dragging me down.  My health -- never great, due to an autoimmune disorder -- was rapidly failing.  I had heart palpitations and trouble breathing; my skin was blotched red almost all the time and I couldn't sleep.  I've been using MFP religiously since May 28th, 2013 and although I'm still not super active I try to make sure I get around with my body rather than a combustion engine.  I've lost over 50 pounds*, dropped five clothing sizes, and somehow found the energy to turn myself back into a reasonable human being.   I'm still working on it, of course.  I have an eight-year-old son who is pretty much the most amazing kid ever.  I'm a single mom to him, and he's the biggest reason I push myself to succeed at work and always do more.  I want to be healthier to show him that health is important, and I want to be healthier so I have more energy to do fun things with him.  I love to read and I'm a TV buff.  These are fairly sedentary activities, so I try to offset them by walking or biking everywhere I can, participating in my life rather than shuffling off to my room, and pushing myself out of the armchair when all I want is a lazy weekend.  I am a former anoretic and I'm using MyFitnessPal not only to keep me on track for weight loss but also so that I can ensure that I'm eating healthfully and eating enough.  It's very easy for me to not just diet, but take it too far and starve or punish myself.  I'm going to try to avoid that as much as I can, but I do worry that dieting again after almost a decade of intuitive eating is going to trigger some old behaviors.  We'll see.  I'm also a crazy cat lady.  I have five cats.  Let us never speak of them.   *January 2015 update: I ended up losing almost 70lbs total, but in September had a bad flare-up of my autoimmune disorder, during which I was almost entirely inactive and taking high doses of steroids. That, combined with a couple of months of despair-eating (not proud of it, but I was feeling really low), has put almost 40lbs back on me. I'm getting back on track now, but that was a big hit to sustain, and I'm struggling at the moment.","I wanted to feel more in control of myself and my habits.  I spent a year working like crazy, and the flipside of that is that in my down time I kept thinking I'd earned the right to do whatever I wanted -- eat all the time, have lots of junk, never exercise, drink too much booze, etc.  I felt like the proverbial fat slob, and I didn't like it.    I'm much better now, 50+ pounds down (writing this in January of 2014), but I still have road left to travel.  My body is so much more comfortable now than it was when I started, lighter and more flexible and less prone to getting in its own way.  Still, I would like to be truly ""average,"" maybe even ""slim"" or ""thin.""  I want to wear cute clothes, not swelter under my own weight in summer, and just generally rejoin the normal world.   *January 2015 update: I'm more like 30 pounds down from my original starting weight right now, due to the regain I mentioned above. I still feel awful (autoimmune-wise, I mean -- aching joints, stiff/weak muscles, fatigue and brainfog), but I know that getting the weight back off and eating to fuel a healthy system will help immensely.",Getting to wear cute clothes; Modeling willpower and health as priorities for my son; Having the energy to be a more productive person; Reducing the pain and fatigue of scleroderma,94

7327,Pootler74,41.0,Female,"Bedlington West Ed, EN",Bedlington West Ed,EN,Being rubbish at something is the first step to learning to be good at it!,"As the daughter of a dieter, I grew up with some weird ideas about food. And as I grew I used food as comfort, and later as a way to feel in control when the rest of my life was totally out of my control.   By reading Geneen Roth, and doing Slimming World, I lost at least 12 kilos, (probably more - I think I may have been as heavy as 117 kilos, and got down to 100)  and I've kept most of them off for about 8 years. I've gone up and down a lot in that time each time learning a bit more about dealing with food in a healthy way. I'm currently combining calorie counting with intuitive eating. Eventually I hope to switch over to intuitive eating altogether, but I don't feel brave enough yet. So just now I'm focussing on figuring out what hunger feels like and how to respond to it.   I completed C25K in 2013 in a slow and sensible way. That was a surprise, and proof that the program works, for just about anyone who can walk briskly.  I (usually) enjoy exercising and miss it on the days when I can't get to the gym or out for a walk. I'll admit it sometimes feels more like work than working out, but I'm never sorry I managed to haul my arse to the gym.  I'm losing steadily, feeling good, building up my cardiovascular fitness, running a little longer and a little faster each month. I never thought this would be me, and I'm thrilled that my body can do this.  Now I'm much calmer around food. I  don't feel controlled by it on a day to day basis, which is a huge change. There are occasional binges - I'm learning from those and trying to work out what the triggers are so I can reduce the risk of them happening again. That's what the motto on my profile is about.    *** MINI GOALS ***  1. 90 kilos. This knocks me out of the 'obese' BMI range. ✔  2. Size 18 trousers everywhere, not just Monsoon, Asda and Next. ✔   3. Size 16 trousers everywhere. ✔  4. 85 kilos.  ✔  5. Size 14 trousers AND a 16 on top, meaning I can buy clothes in most high street stores.  ✔  6. 80 kilos. ✔  7. 75 kilos. 2 kilos into the healthy weight range.  ✔  8. Size 12 trousers.   9. Size L at Zara fits.   10. 70 kilos? Not sure! When I first set my target 75 seemed like something I would never achieve. But at 75 there's still fat left, and plenty of toning to do. So perhaps a bit lower? I'll take it a pound at a time I think. And move the focus to recomp at about 73.","There are lots of reasons, but primarily the usual ones about living a long and healthy life. I'm a single mum now and my son's dad lives abroad. Since he has special needs that I seem to be able to deal with better than anyone else, I really need to make sure I'm here for him until he no longer needs me.

31,20yearsyounger,40.0,Male,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Fort Lauderdale,FL,Want to be that 70 year old you see in the gym,"9/10/2014: Got to my goal weight of 165 before with the help of myfitnesspal and lots of moderate walking but fell off the wagon. Now I am re-dedicating myself to activities I enjoy without making exercising my day job. 5-8 hours a week is good for me. Need to track my eating again and develop habits that will work for life so that I can always feel 20 years younger than I really am.   Update 10/21/2014: I am 1 pound away from my original MFP goal of 165. However, I realized that my goal was a little too conservative. My body hasn't slowed down the weight loss process and I'm still above 20% body fat. Going to go further. Maybe 155 is the number?  Update 12/27/2014: Does it really matter? I'm ready to move on from focusing on losing weight. My new fitness band has me excited about challenging myself. All I need to do is eat right and focus on working out without injuring myself. Eventually I will get to my goal of 13% Body Fat. Until then, I will just continue to enjoy myself and support others in their journey.  Update 2/1/2015 Some how I have gone from some who detested running for no reason to wanting to run as a primary exercise. Maybe all that time on the elliptical had something to do with it. I'm a lot lighter now and I don't get shin splints anymore. I don't see myself running any marathon, but I said the same thing about a 5K and now a 10K. I'll just take every day one step at a time.   Update 2/16/2015  Today I ran 25K (that's slightly over a half marathon). Somebody stop me. I know for sure I am not crazy enough to run a marathon.  Update 4/25/2015  I feel comfortable saying that I am at 11% BF @ 154.6 lbs.   Update 6/5/2015  Decided to test the fitness knowledge I acquired and obtained a Group Fitness Instructor Certification (no plans to do much with it). Currently working on a Health Coach Certification  I'm open to new friends so feel free to add me.

I understand that some people are shy and don't know what to say, but something is better than nothing! If anything, please let me know how you found me in the first place. :D ****  Hello. I'm a young woman on a journey to achieve many things. Back in 2006, I graduated high school and tried my hardest to figure out just how in the world I was going to get myself through college without a loan--I graduated with two degrees, high honors, in the Spring of 2012.  In 2007, I struggled with which path I should take and what career to strive for--today I am trained in computers, looking for employment, and planning my future career in graphic design and becoming an author.   Several years ago I tried to blindly diet and walk for exercise--today I'm about 27-30lbs lighter than I was then with knowledge and precise routines.  In 2010, I started to date a childhood friend who showed me that I am beautiful. I lived with him and his best friend in Louisiana for two years.  I have been through a lot growing up, but the only thing we really need to hold onto from our past is what we learned from it. I learned that you will never succeed unless you stubbornly pursue and do your best to achieve your goals; not to mention, I learned to be myself--the friends and loved ones you gain with your natural personality will be the most authentic.  **** The Plan ****  Starting Weight: 191.2 lbs 07.11.2011 Current Weight: 159.5 lbs 09.20.2015 Goal Weight: 120 lbs by 05.04.2016  **** Mini Goals ****  165 lbs - .: Energized :.

[  ] Run a MARATHON!   I am a 25 year old, who has struggled with her weight for a long time. In all of my adult life, I have never been thin, though I had always fooled myself into thinking I was fit...and at over 200 lbs, I was living in denial for over 6 years. Much of my weight gain was during the start of college, when I put on 30 lbs in my freshmen year and clocked in at my highest weight of 215 lbs. two years later, sick of being fat and feeling unhappy and uncomfortable in my own skin, I lost 37 lbs in 2 months due to a burst in motivation and self discipline during my summer off...reaching my lowest adult weight of 178 lbs. Unfortunately, my 2-a-day workout schedule was impossible to maintain during school, and I began to YO-YO, mostly sitting around 190 lbs for the next few years. I had always been fairly active, and enjoyed playing rugby most of all, so I decided to take it up again (after 4 years off). During my first season back, weighing 207 lbs, I was desperately in need of a change, so I had decided that I was on a mission to lose 47 lbs and finally be the size I wanted to be. Unfortunately, one week into my mission (and after losing 7 lbs in my initial week) I completely  tore my ACL (during rugby practice) and was on crutches for 2 weeks. This derailed my plans, and was a huge blow to my motivation...and also led to me passing my highest weight (after putting on 15 lbs in two months after ACL reconstruction surgery). Seeing this number (218) was another huge blow...and this time, I decided, that instead of feeling sorry for myself- I would use it as an obstacle to overcome to reach my goals. So I started working very hard at losing weight. I was almost 30 lbs down, feeling really fantastic, and also had my knee strength almost to 95% so I started playing rugby again- which made me happier than I could imagine. I was loving it so much, I was below 193 lbs consistently, and extremely happy- UNTIL- I tore my other acl (the one on my good knee) due to an extremely unfortunate stroke of bad luck during rugby practice. This was extremely depressing, as I had been bested by the same injury twice. And what was worse- was that this injury was a lot more troublesome to recover from, as there was more damage than my last one. Now I am almost 1.5 years post ACL surgery #2, in plenty of knee pain regularly, and up to 227 lbs. I also had to redo my MFP profile, and erase all of my previously accomplished milestones and goals, because none of them would be applicable anymore. Instead of just crawling into a hole, and giving up on ever being happy and active again, I will take this as just another obstacle I need to overcome in order to lose this weight once and for all. It will be much slower and harder this time, but I am a pretty strong lady- so I definitely know I can do it. This is my new journey, starting over from the beginning. Nothing from before will matter- what matters is what I am going to do now- on this journey to finally get over the unfortunate incidents that led me to this point, and to not let ANY excuses hold me back. I want to be able to run again, I want to be able to feel strong again, and I want to be able to overcome this set of obstacles and prove to everyone (especially myself) that I am not letting anything stop me from achieving my goals. So...slowly but surely, I will be inching my way towards my goal weight of 155 lbs...and I'm not going to make any excuses for myself! This time, it's for good.","More than anything, I want to be happy and comfortable in my own skin! I want to look like on the outside, what I feel like on the inside!

What I want more than to get to my goal weight quickly is to get to my goal weight and stay there!

7640,resafabulous,34.0,Female,"Duluth, GA",Duluth,GA,Distill the Awesomeness Within so Everyone can See it!,"Hi! I'm super stoked about being at MyFitnessPal, and really excited to get to work! I grew up an overweight child. I remember being taller and bigger than almost anyone in my class from a small age, and it just continued as I got older. I thought being fit was for other people-- my Mom and Dad were both big, and I was big-- I just thought that was how it was. I didn't know anything about nutrition or exercise or portion control. When I got older and went to college, I had a 'fluffy' roommate who went to the gym and ate well, and I started to see how it could be done.  A big turning point in my life, though, happened when I moved to New York City. Four months after getting there, when I finally had found two jobs, made some friends, and settled in, I got run over by a Jeep. This was major setback to say the least, and I spent the next nine months dealing with stitches, IVs, and walking canes. I have ongoing injuries related to that accident, including three herniated discs in my lower back. These were actually sustained when I tried to work out (for the first time in my life) and had no idea what I was doing!  Getting healthy has always been in the back of my mind, but until recently I didn't really do anything about it. My body is fighting back though, and I am listening. Since joining MyFitnessPal, I have worked out safely and worked on portion sizes and healthy choices. I love to swim since it takes the pressure off my back and is a great all-body workout-- nice too you don't notice how hard you're sweating :o)  The biggest part of my story, though, has to do with mindset. I have always balked at the idea of 'losing weight.' Since I have been bigger almost my whole life, I feel like I might not know who I am if suddenly I'm a waif. To be honest, I don't see myself attaining waif status anytime soon, but I still don't want to think of myself as a loser, or as of losing who I am.   Everyday I work out, or make a better choice, or let go of needing to eat when I am full, I am a winner! To me, this process is about distilling, concentrating, becoming more by measuring less around the waist. I am letting the world see on the outside who I already am on the inside-- an awesome, excited, amazing woman!","I don't want to get in shape, I LOVE my shape. I want to get in health! I want to be able to run, skip, jump, swim, and DANCE whenever I want! I want to live pain-free, and that means being healthy and paying attention to my body. I want to turn heads even more than I already do!","I love life, and the people in my life, so much. Let’s live it!; The challenge is exciting.

Started MFP to track food, because that HAD to be the issue, as I was killing myself with strength training and cardio, yet going nowhere.   I've had my fair share of injuries and setbacks (tendonitis in my feet, The Great  Iliosacral Strain of 2013, and now with the budding plantar fasciitis), but I haven't let any of that stop me. I just do what I can within my current capabilities.   Right now, I'm revisiting Turbo Jam with weighted gloves along with Piyo. Once the time changes and the weather levels off with more sunlight in the afternoons, I'll start running more often in my neighborhood.   I do still run with the hash a couple of times per week, which for me ends up being a mix of walking and running for 3-5 miles.   It's taken a while for me to find the balance between endurance, strength, and flexibility. Now that I understand how important all three are, I feel like I have better focus when it comes to fitness.   Plus, I need to build core strength to avoid future injury (That SI strain SUCKED), and Piyo offers that as well.   As much as I *liked* ChaLean Extreme, I have to be honest and say that I didn't really *love* it. It turns out that I prefer bodyweight strength training vs. weights. Fitness Blender has some AWESOME bodyweight and HIIT workouts that I use regularly.  How I set my calories/macros: Courtesy of HelloItsDan's ""In Place Of A Road Map"", I have my calorie goals set based on TDEE - 20%. Macros 40/30/30. This might be the single best thing I've done since joining MFP. I find it to be much more realistic and manageable than the MFP way of using food as a reward.   http://www.myfitnesspal.com/topics/show/975025-in-place-of-a-road-map-short-n-sweet  This thread also puts it all out there:  http://www.myfitnesspal.com/topics/show/1080242-a-guide-to-get-you-started-on-your-path-to-sexypants  This is the calculator I use. I average between the light activity and moderate activity levels:   http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/  (That will help explain why all of my calorie burns are 1 calorie. Exercise is already factored into my calorie goal, so no need to log the burn.)  I went from November 2012 to April of 2013 without losing a single pound. But I lost almost two pants sizes.   Basically, I try not to stress about all the little details and keep things simple and enjoyable.","I love that it's ""get in shape"" and not ""lose weight"". While I do have weight to lose, my ultimate goal is to gain strength, retain as much lean body mass as possible, and lose fat, rather than hit a scale number.   I've hit the ""Over-40"" mark, and while I have always been a pretty active person, my food choices and metabolism have caught up with me. It's time to get back to where I was in my late 20's, before I traded in an ""active"" job for a ""sedentary"" job.   One of the best things I did was quit smoking (01/20/2008). Of course, I gained the requisite weight with it, but I managed to take it back off pretty quickly, so there's that.   I also have a pretty crappy family history with high blood pressure and diabetes on the menu. I refuse to have to take a handful of pills every day to keep things in check. So far, so good. I'm a huge believer that diet and exercise can control just about anything, and I'm always looking to better myself with regard to nutrition and fitness.  I'd rather take care of myself now than be screwed down the road when I'm older and my metabolism REALLY slows down.

MFP really changed my life. I still like the colour black and video games though ;)  I love trail running, hiking, geocaching, mountain biking, camping... Anything to do with the outdoors and I'm there. I'm also a mad gadget man, got a Garmin Fenix 3, GPSmap 64 and Virb action camera. I'm starting up a youtube channel and blog soon for our geocaching adventures as we've had some pretty crazy geocache finds at the bottom of lakes, up sheer rock faces and up trees.  When it comes to running, my dad is my inspiration and hero. He comes alive when he talks about running and he has that raw energetic and philosophical enjoyment which I've only now discovered in myself too.   I do still love my video games though, I used to play mainly MMOs like Star Trek Online, Guild Wars 1 & 2, Lotro etc but stick now to Xbox One, New 3DS XL, retro amiga and pc games. At the minute I'm hooked on GTA online, minecraft (been building my multi city world for over 5 years now), assassin's creed and pokemon games.  I also still stick to my roots music wise and still love cyberpunk, EBM, aggrotech, darkwave, etc.  Since I lost weight I've found a love for buying clothes and accessories. I may confuse, one minute I'm wearing alternative and goth stuff, the next I've got on a full hiking and outdoor gear. I just love the fact that I can start getting into any clothing I want now.

Husband and I are both in agreement that this will be the last baby, so I'm ready to lose the baby weight! My tiny little under 7 lb baby girls left me with no stretch marks and the full possibility to get my honeymoon body back!   I live in Northern VA (and yes. it is VERY different from the rest of VA) and work at one of the large defense contractors as a Program Manager. My free time is spent with my amazing husband and my daughters Carly and Caity (love!) Favorite activities include walking my puggle baby, snowboarding (which I haven't done since before my first, can't wait to get back out on the slopes next season!), and of course shopping (even more when I'm skinny and everything looks good!)  About My Success (pre-pregnancy): So everyone always asks for tips. Let me start off by saying that I am 5'4"". At my heaviest weight (pre-MFP) I was probably around 180-185. I lost 40 lbs and then gained back about 20 because what I did to lose the 40 lbs was not a sustainable lifestyle change. I was eating nothing for breakfast, yogurt and pretzels for lunch and whatever I wanted for dinner. I worked out a lot but at no point did I understand the number of calories I was consuming or the number I was burning. As soon as I stopped working out and started eating breakfast and lunch again I gained. Luckily I got engaged and re-motivated to lose weight before I got back to the 180's. I lost 30 lbs in approximately 8 months and am happier with my body than I have ever been. So what are my tips?  1. Log ALL of your food! Even when you're tempted not to, put it in! It doesn't have to be 100% accurate but the MFP food database has just about everything so you should get relatively close to the number of calories you consume a day. If you are just starting, it will be eye opening! I couldn't believe how many calories some of the things I used to eat on a regular basis had.   2. Don't cut anything out of your diet permanently... It's about making it work for you on a daily basis for the rest of your life. Telling yourself you can't have cookies when they are your favorite food (that's mine :-P) is just going to make you want cookies more. Just make sure you have enough calories left in your day to account for the cookies. It's all about the total calories you eat every day.   3. You don't have to exercise every day. I try to exercise 3-4 times a week now that I am in maintenance mode. When I was losing weight, I was exercising 5-6 times a week for 30-60 minutes a day. You don't need a gym membership. The only exercises I do consistently are Jillian Michael's workout videos (with 5 lb weights) and walking my dogs.   4. Weigh yourself every day. It reminds you why you are doing this and what you are trying to accomplish and keeps you aware of where you are at. Yes the number will fluctuate which is why you need ONE set day that you RECORD that weight. No other days count in terms of recording except that one day (trust me you'll be tempted to count ""good"" days ... lol)   5. Drink lots of water!! It makes you crave food less and keeps your body well hydrated. I've also seen a lot of improvement in my skin!   6. Figure out what you're going to eat if you're going out to eat at a restaurant BEFORE you go! Most restaurants have their menus online and a lot of them include nutritional information!   7. Believe in yourself! I am all about having a positive attitude in life. Believe it achieve it! You get out of life what you expect, so always expect good things! This goes for more than just weight loss!  Obviously I am not a professional, the tips above are just what worked for me. Everyone's body is different and everyone has different goals. Good luck to everyone and thank you all for inspiring me to get where I am today!","Being healthy and skinny and feeling good about myself makes me so happy!

Commitment is not just saying you'll do it.  Commitment is doing it.  True Commitment is not conditional, for to be committed means to be absolutely committed.  Commitment is more than doing just what is convenient or comfortable.  Commitment is doing what is necessary.  Commitment is making the sacrifices and the tradeoffs that are required to uphold it.   Commitment is more than just wishing for the right conditions. Commitment is working with what you have.  Commitment is not easy.  Commitment does not back down or run away at the first sign of trouble.  Commitment perseveres until the goal is reached. Commitment does not waste time and effort whining or complaining or seeking to find blame.  Commitment adjusts to reality and moves forward.  Too many people have been deceived for too long, and have come to expect that they can know fulfillment without the gritty effort of commitment.  They are sadly mistaken.  Real, solid commitment is real work.  And well worth it.  The evidence is overwhelming -- it gets results like nothing else can.   --Ralph Marston  Well, my name is Kirsten, I'm 23, and I'm currently attending the Digital Animation and Visual Effects (DAVE) School in Orlando, FL. I majored in Graphic Design at Park University, and graduated with a Bachelors. I have been going out with my wonderful boyfriend, Bobby, for almost 5 years now. I think I'm a pretty funny person, and usually I'm right...   I have always been trying to lose weight. It's super hard. But, I have lost more weight these past couple years than I have in my whole life. :) I feel I have the confidence to lose what I want to, by the time I need to!  When I notice that I'm getting smaller, I feel good about this weight loss thing. I know that everyone does, but somehow it just feels better to me. I guess because I was a heavy child and have been heavy before now... well not that I still am, but 25 pounds lighter already... I just thought that I would always look like I did.

I could not walk to the end of my driveway to get the mail.  I could only go to restaurants that had tables & chairs because I could not fit into the booths.  Forget about going to the movies, no way I was fitting into those seats.  Only went to stores that offered scooters for me to ride around in.  The only clothing I could buy was from on-line stores offering ""super sizes"". But worse than that... I was so unhealthy.  I had developed infections in my legs due to lymphedema that took almost three years to heal, and they only started healing when I started losing the weight.  I saw a wound doctor 2x per week in effort to get them cured.  I had numerous lengthy hospitalizations which included 2 skin grafts in effort to get the skin to start growing on my legs again.  I had to give up a job that I loved and had for 12 years.  I had to give my apartment & move in with family because I had no income and needed help changing the dressings on my legs 3x a day.  Painful? ... oh yes.  When the doctor scraped the dead, infected skin off the wounds and when I had to use a bleach based solution on them in effort to kill the germs.  The doctor was worried about having to amputate, I was worried about dieing young.  Finally after a couple of years of that,woke up and said enough.  So I changed my life.   I have been struggling the past year and while I blame no one else for my choices, I have made a significant change to my life in May 2012 by separating from my husband and moving back in with my sister (we had been roommates for years before I met my ex and moved away).  He did not encourage me in any way to make bad choices so I do not in any way blame him but reducing stress has helped.

There is no secret to weight loss. Watch what you eat, you can eat anything in moderation and most importantly, MOVE. Instead of sitting and stuffing your face during your lunch hour, take a walk around the parking lot, or down to the corner store.

I blissfully co-habitate with my LT boyfriend, a dog, and a cat in a house in the suburbs of Omaha. I'm a technical writer and (recently) software tester by trade. I'm an avid recreational cyclist (road & mountain) averaging over 6,000 miles/year. I also bike commute to work often. I also love to walk my dog, hike, camp, kayak, geocache, and anything else that gets me outside.  In my twenties, my weight crept up to 265+ lbs. (I never knew my highest weight because I eventually stopped weighing myself after 265.) I wore a size 26/28. I would get winded walking up a single flight of stairs. I was always fatigued. Around that time, I was also diagnosed with PCOS - it was upsetting at first, but I found some comfort in finally understanding what was ailing me. As we all know, life is full of challenges - big and small...  In 1999/2000, both of my parents suffered serious cerebro- and cardiovascular health problems. My mom died of a massive hemorrhagic stroke at 59 - due to a now-banned diet drug. Less than a year later, my dad suffered a disabling ischemic stroke (also at 59) and went on to develop advanced congestive heart failure. He was so disabled, I had to provide around-the-clock care for him in my home for his remaining years. (It actually inspired me to complete an A.S. nursing degree.) At age 68, he finally succumbed to heart disease (2010). My parents' health problems became a significant turning point for me (an epiphany) and made me realize that I had to take charge of my health - or face a similar fate.  It took me about 3 years to go from 265+ to 145 lbs (i.e., 120 lbs). I diligently counted calories, became vegetarian (short-lived, but enjoyable), disconnected the TV/cable, discovered biking, finally learned to swim, discovered yoga, and just tried to be as active as possible.  All went well until I stopped being so diligent about my exercise & diet. I started to ""coast"". I shrugged off calorie counting and my fitness slowly fell by the wayside. Everything else took priority - work, family, school. I could have made time to exercise and eat right, but I made excuses... and I gained back around 40 ""rebound"" pounds over several years.  Needless to say, I decided to stop making excuses. So here I am.  Friends are welcome. Cheers.","(Done!) To regain ability post broken leg (MTB crash 4/3/12).  (Done!)

I'm married and have three children (29, 26, and 15), two grandchildren (6 yrs old  and 3 yr old, and a five month old)  When I was younger, I was very thin and could eat whatever I wanted, never understood what it meant to watch my weight... until having kids.  I started young and was suddenly in a position I had never been in before.  No one had ever taught me how to eat right or exercise (other than for fun).  Since then I have lost and gained weight many times, but it was always pretty easy once I set my mind to it.  Until I hit 40.....  The 40s have been rough so far.  Losing weight has never been so difficult.  I'm not going to let it win, but dang. :)  Definitely, more of a life changing event now than it ever was in the past.  I started out (once again) counting calories and doing mainly cardio.  I've done P90X in the past, but honestly didn't feel like it did much for me.  I didn't lose much weight or inches and for the amount of time spent working out, I felt I should have seen more.  By the time I was done, I still couldn't do more than a couple of push-ups.  In March 2012 I started doing New Rules of Lifting for Women (NROLFW).  I'm in LOVE!!!  I learned of this program on here and I can now do 60 decline push-ups (at least 20-25 without a break).  I actually look forward to my workout days and get excited when I can increase the amount of weight I'm lifting.  Now I would like to master a pull-up\chin-up. :)  UPDATE:  1/27/13 Finally managed a chin-up, now working to get up to 10 in a row.  UPDATE 8/23/12:  Finished NROL4W of lifting, great experience and now I'm on to Stronglifts.  Have to admit, felt my workouts were much longer and tougher with NROL, but I do feel I'm gaining strength with Stronglifts.  I've starting incorporating some other things in as well just to feel I'm getting more out of it.  Also took up running and doing that 3-4 times per week (3-4 miles at a time).  Working on lowering my times, currently around a 9:15 min/mile  UPDATE 1/29/13: Decided to try New Rules of Lifting for Men.  Really enjoyed the women's program but looking for something that incorporates more barbell work.  I'm starting with the hypertrophy portion and so far I'm really diggin' it. :)  UPDATE 5/28/13: Decided to try doing my own thing this go around.  Went to Bodybuilder.com and built my own program (using some of their templates).  See how this goes.  Still doing all the compound exercises and throwing in some isolation stuff.  UPDATE 9/28/13: Going to start a 3 month bulk and see where it gets me.  I'm going to follow a friend and try the Layne Norton's Power and Hypertrophy routine.  Looks pretty intense.  It's a 5 day workout, but I'm going to combine a portion and do 4 days.  Took all my measurements today and can't wait to see where I'm at in 4 months (might have to extend depending).

Never was too concerned before but was always unhappy with my body through high school and college. Becoming healthy has taken care of chronic ankle issues that I had for years.  I started researching the Paleo diet in October 2012 and put it into full effect in January 2013. I was able to do this with some adjustments for about 6 months.

I'm not a friend collector, everyone on my list is there because I like what they have to say. If I drop you from my friend list, don't take it personally because it won't have been meant that way. Likewise if you drop me, I won't take personally. Not all people are meant to be friends, and that's ok.  I first joined MFP in 2013. I was an ex-martial artist who let myself get horribly out of shape after my daughter was born in 2006. After all, who wants to be surrounded by sweaty people hitting each other when there's a sweet little girl waiting to give you hugs and read stories when you get home from work?   I was 220lb, I couldn't run for the school bus and I got out of breath walking up stairs. My cholesterol hit 250, and I was told I was on a trajectory for a middle-age heart attack. I lost my mother to breast cancer. I had my first two hospital stays (albeit for kidney stones, but still worrying). All these things combined catalyzed me to action. Something had to change.  Things are very, very different now. I'm now 165lb, after getting down to 155 and then building a little muscle (and a bit of fat with it). I lift heavy things and put them back down again. I run - a lot. I swim. I cycle. I ran my first triathlon last year (2014) with a time of 3h23m. Most importantly I didn't rest on the 1500m swim, I went balls-out on the 40k cycle, and despite 105 degree heat and 90%+ humidity I ran the full 10k run-leg, no walking, while others dropped like flies.  Over the winter I hit a 365lb deadlift, 235lb squat and 175lb bench, which I was pretty pleased with since I've never been a strong guy.  Currently I'm training for the 2015 Lake Saint Louis triathlon. Hoping to finish further up the standings this time.

Being overweight was not a problem during most of my life. In fact, there have been only two periods when I've really been overweight...in the period shortly after my son was born and in the period after 1998 through 2007.   In 1997, lifestyle, a job change, and other life events over the next decade had my weight creep up to 250-252 pounds. I took my first steps (literally) to weight loss in 2008.  Not so much diet control but much more physical activity got me down to 214 pounds by the end of the summer of 2008.   But there was no plan for sustaining progress or maintaining the weight loss and I allowed other things to get in the way.  So, I gained nearly half of my weight loss back and by the end of 2009 I was back up to 232 pounds.    In 2010, I joined a walking team competition and the weight fell off.  The sustained walking eventually got me down to 190 pounds by the end of 2010 where I stayed for most of 2011.  My body was still changing in 2011, but it did NOT show up on the scale and the numbers it displayed. Using a pedometer and then a Fitbit to track my daily steps was a good way for me to track my activity goals.  You can also see me at Fitbit- http://www.fitbit.com/user/23BVQ9  I obtained a new Android Phone in early 2012 and installed the MFP app on it to keep track of my daily activities.  I had already tracked daily steps/ aerobic steps since 2010.   The combination of physical activity and logging my food precisely has taken me down to my current (maintenance) weight.

Friend requests with no message will be deleted.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Please note, the high weight on my ticker of 186 lbs is from around the time of my hypothyroid diagnosis in 2010, not when I started MFP in 2012, that weight was 165 lbs. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Hello there!  My name is Jenni, mom to two, a 22 year old daughter and a 17 year old son (who make me look like a midget!), and wife to one wonderful man.  I’m hypothyroid, having been diagnosed in May 2010. This means I have a slower metabolism which can make it more difficult to lose weight.  It’s not impossible, as I’ve shown with my losses, but it can be tougher.  I lost about 40 pounds after my initial diagnosis, then slacked off about a year later, stopped working out and paying attention to what I was eating and wound up gaining back about 15-20 of the 40 I had lost.   I decided in January 2012 that I needed to start doing something about the weight I’d regained and joined MFP at that time. I lost about 7 pounds between mid-January and the beginning of April when I started working out again on a regular basis.  It took me from April 3-August 8, so just about 4 months, to lose the remaining 18 pounds I had to lose, which is not too shabby. :-)   Since that time, I’ve maintained the loss by continuing to do the things that I did to lose.  I still keep track of what I’m putting in my mouth and I still work out regularly.  I’m at 2+ years of maintenance at this point and I just don’t see any reason to mess with the success.  Will I log forever?  I have no idea, but I think what logging does for me is helps me keep myself accountable…  To myself.    I’ve listed below the programs I’ve done since starting back with the workouts in 2012.  I’ve previously done 10 Minute Trainer and will occasionally throw a couple of those workouts together just for a change up to my routine.  I will also throw in the kickboxing DVD I have, as it’s a lot of fun.  I’ve taken Zumba classes in the past, I own some Zumba games and DVDs, but haven’t done any of them regularly since 2013.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Programs I’ve done (repeats listed as well): *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred  Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix Jillian Michaels 6 Week 6 Pack  Jillian Michaels Killer Abs Jillian Michaels Body Revolution  Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30  Jillian Michaels Killer Abs  Focus T25  (Alpha, Beta, Gamma ""Pure Gamma"" schedule followed by ""Pure Strength"" schedule.)

Little explanation to the username: iRun, because well, I run, and I also lift so trying to play with iRun=Iron. Butterfly to symbolize metamorphosis and transformation, as both of the activities of choice have truly transformed my body and life. And, hell, who can't get behind a little ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"".   I'm quickly approaching the 2 year mark on this latest escapade at losing weight and finding my fitness. On August 9, 2013 I decided yet again, for probably the fifth or sixth time that year, that I was finally going to lose the weight I had regained over the past 4 years. I set out that day, signed up for Weight Watchers online and began what I was sure was yet another half assed attempt at weight loss. I was inspired by a very dear friend of mine who that same summer had started running, walking, playing with his kids, and eating right. He convinced me through the summer of 2013 that I was beautiful and worth-while, even though I was heavy, he saw this in me. Something changed, I started seeing it in myself as well and I decided I deserved to FEEL like what he saw. So, I spent a month on WW, plugging away, eating a pitiful amount, exercising, and barely seeing the scale move. I invested in a Fitbit the end of August and for some reason, that silly little piece of plastic really changed something in me. It made me want to move!! It made me want to move A LOT!! I re-up'ed a long forgotten MPF account and realized I could actually eat and have fun! And that is when half assed became all out, balls to the wall, lets get fit!!! By mid-September I was starting to run, slowly, short distances. A quarter mile killed me, but I was determined, damn it!! I have always wanted to run, used to dream about it, dream about the freedom, about my body being light and moving freely and easily along the streets. Yeah...it wasn't like my dreams, still isn't..lol...but I kept on. It took me almost 3 months to finally be able to run a mile. But once I accomplished that first full mile I felt like a real runner. Soon after the first of 2014 I was pushing toward my 2nd full mile, then to my 3rd. That 3rd mile was a struggle, until I met my dear friend on here (you know who you are) and she inspired me, gave me the motivation to push through, to ""surprise myself"". I made it, 3 miles in Mid March, and I've been rocking since then!! I completed my first official 5K in June 2014 and leap frogged to my first HM in May, 2015. I lift heavy on a regular basis and love the strength and confidence it has given me! So, every single day, I remind myself, I am worth this battle and I keep on surprising myself!  I think of where I started, only half serious, to where I've found myself, dedicated, determined, happy, and getting fitter every single day, and I can't thank the people I've come across enough for their support and motivation. I have a long way to go, I'm far from finished, and I can only imagine who or what I will encounter along the way. My only regret so far is that I waited until I was almost 35 years old to start living, to figure out how good I can really feel.   So, the point I suppose, find what inspires you, keep your eyes open and take it all in and allow yourself to be moved and motivated and YOU WILL BE successful! If the process is nothing but a drag, like it had always been for me, it's not going to work. You've gotta find that one thing, or series of things, or people, who move your mind, soul, body.

5904,mcsteenie,37.0,Female,"Las Vegas, NV",Las Vegas,NV,recently diagnosed diabetic (type II) AND newly pregnant mom! (due 7/17/15),"My Blog:  http://www.myfitnesspal.com/blog/mcsteenie  Hi. I'm Steenie. Aka Christine but Steenie seems to have stuck. The McSteenie comes from an aunt who used to call me Steenie McBeanie... So um, yeah. No scars there. JK. ;)  I am thirty- *muffling mouth*  years old.  And I flippin' love food. L.O.V.E. it! Like, if food were an entity I would marry it. Like that guy who married his car a while back. To say I have a sorted past with food is an understatement.    When I started this ""journey"" back in March 2013,  I weighted 228 lbs. (BTW does anyone else want to yell *journey* and slam a drink when they say that on Biggest Loser or it just me?)   At my heaviest in August 2011 I weighed 238 lbs. I think a low point for me was when a nurse at my Dr's office looked at me, as she was taking my stats, and asked "" How tall are you?""  To which I reply 5' 7"" on a good day.  And She frowned and said. ""OH NO, you are 5' 4"", MAYBE.""   I looked at her and said ""So what you're saying is that not only am I FAT but I'm short as well? I may be one of those, and it ain't short, lady.""   Talk about a rude awaking of a BMI.   Anyway, other factoids...  I was born in CHicago (GO CUBBIES!), but was raised in Ohio (GO BUCKEYES!). We are a recently retired AF military family so we have lived all over the place.   I know I'm an apple shape. I know I have a family history of, well, every BAD disease and ailment know to obese people. Diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease... I could go on but this could take awhile.   I decided to do this (lose weight) because of *drum roll* PEER PRESSUE.   My BF/SIL joined WW and I was jealous. I felt like I was left behind. Dark,but true. I decided to do something about it. I joined MFP and started counting calories in March of 2012. In June 2012 I signed up for a half marathon in January 2013. When I came out of my fog of insanity, I realized this meant I would have to start exercising. REGULARLY. Epp!  I started a  training regimen recommended for beginning runners that would allow me to JUST FINISH my marathon (Tinkerbell 1/2 at DisneyLand) in the maximum time allotted. I run 3 times a week. ANOTHER thing I never thought I would see myself doing as I have NEVER been anything remotely close to athletic or... coordinated for that matter.  Last Factoid: I have lost weight before. 70 lbs to be precise, back in 1999. I did it through EXTREMELY low caloric intake. Which I WOULD NOT recommend to anyone. I was warned what I was doing was playing Russian roulette with my body and I'm dang lucky I came out okay from it. (Although I am still convinced it lead to some wicked kidney infections later on that year.) If you want to read more about that journey, see my blog post from Sept.  http://www.myfitnesspal.com/blog/mcsteenie/view/how-i-got-this-way-427165","I want to be a better version of myself.

One of them has some more intense parenting needs.  I am a stay-at-home mom; my hubby works full time and goes to school full time- so sometimes kind of a ""single mom""!  We live out in the country- read: alot of outside work.  I love to plan fun things to do as a family, garden, get together with friends and have a cup of coffee by myself before the kids get up (never happens).  I follow Jesus and believe He meant every word He said...  I am 5'5"" and have a small bone structure.  I was close to 200 pounds right before the birth of my last child.  (3 C-Sections! Goodbye Abs) I lost that weight over a year and am now trying to maintain a steady 119 while building muscle and lowering my body fat percentage.  I really struggle with my tummy area.  I tend to do a circuit style training of HIIT mixed with strength training.  I LOVE kettlebell workouts and think I have seen great results from them.  I use the FitnessBlender youtubes for those.  I have begun to enjoy running too and can now do 10k in about an hour.  Mostly I love variety.  I can barely stand to do the same thing twice in a row which means I will often do three different tricep moves in an arm session rather then 3 sets of the same.  Unfortunately food continues to a struggle.  I love eating real food.  My true favorite meals would include grilled chicken and fresh spinach and strawberry salad.  However, I often go for weeks turning down an ice cream cone and then ruin it all with 4 pieces of peanut butter bread, two bowls of ice cream and 6 peanut butter cups!  Did anyone say peanut butter.  I believe I have some disordered eating habits as a result of several un-healthy choices I have made.  Trying to turn it around is another story.   That said, I am a pretty big believer in the whole ""nutritious eating"" thing.  I do eat treats and occasionally alcohol but I try to have most of my calories come from real foods.  *I like to have friends with some pretty basic things in common, such as: gender, age, being a mom.

5513,luckydays27,43.0,Female,"Fort Macarthur, CA",Fort Macarthur,CA,I am a work in progress...,"I often get asked how I am losing the weight. Here are the 10 biggest things that has helped me:   1. I started MFP with a 1 lb weight loss goal. It seemed reasonable and sustainable (especially after all the times I failed at trying to lose more weight faster). I am eating maintenance  since I am getting close to where I want to be. Still trying to figure out what maintenance though...  2. I wear a Fitbit and sync it to MFP. It was also set to a 1 lb a week weight loss goal. (Currently set at maintenance) This tells me how many calories I burn all day long just living my life.   3. I wear a heart rate monitor (Polar FT60) when exercising so I can know how many calories I burn during exercise.   4. I eat most of the calories that I burn from the FB and HRM. Most days I eat at least 1800 cals. Depending on my activity level of the day, I eat more than that. And yes, I still lose weight.   5. I dont deprive myself of any foods that I enjoy but I only eat what I have room for in my ""calorie bank"". If I want ice cream I eat it but not if I dont have enough calories for it (or if I still want it, I eat it and dont beat myself up for it).  6. No food is restricted from my diet unless I just dont like that particular food. I eat out frequently and I try to make good choices when I do but I dont restrict the stuff I like because I will eat those foods again when I reach my goal so I need to learn how to make them work now.   7. I try to eat veggies with lunch and dinner and fruit throughout the day. I am not always successful though.  8. I weight my foods with a digital food scale and measure my free flowing liquids. I was amazed at what 1/4 cup serving of cheese weighed out to. No wonder why I was not losing weight.   9. Drink water. Lots of water. At least half your body weight in ounces. I did not give up my soda either.   10. Sleep - I sleep 8 hours every night, always have, and hope I always will.   *************** At the end of it all, there is no short cut. You have to work at it, each and every day. The more you work at the the more changes you will make.   When I slip and don't work at it one day, I dont let it screw me up for the day, week, month, year. I get up and do it right the next day, and each day thereafter.   Because I have taken this process slow, I am never deprived.

I am lucky enough to have an employer who lets me work from home, however working from home has it downfalls. You don't get out much, constant distractions and more convenient to go to the fridge when you are bored. So to cancel the boredom eating I workout at least 5 times a week.. I love doing spin and I will do some weights as well as part of my workouts.And I am a runner so I am training for a race at any given time throughout the year. I have learned that my body likes to hold onto this fat that it has accumulated and it takes me a lot longer to lose weight. As long as it comes off I am happy. And if I gain a week then that just means I need to watch it and work out a little harder the next week.

I bought myself a trainer at the gym which was the best decision I have ever made. I lost 35 more pounds in 4 months. In about a years time with the combination of weight watchers and knowing how to work out, I lost 50 pounds by March 2014. I stopped Weight Watchers because it was getting to be an expense and I fell in love with MFP. From March, I have maintained my 50 pounds I lost, but I still have about 20 more to go. I was getting frustrated with the plateau I was on eating at 1400 calories. However, I knew I could not go lower. I came across Eating More 2 Weigh Less (EM2WL) in December. The science made sense and I thought that is what my problem was. I began on December 8 and I am being honest when I say that this is a daily struggle trying to tell myself that its OK to eat more.

Trips around the Schurr High School track on a scooter evolved into walking and eventually into running. By the time I was 9 years old, we were running 7 miles together three days a week. This was the greatest feeling in the world. The high of knowing at such a young age that with hard work could come great results. At 14 years old I was signed up with him at Bally Total Fitness (with special permission of the manager Yuriv who was one of the coolest dudes ever), and by 15 my biceps were bursting out of my shirts.  Years later, I got away from my fitness as a result of high school, college, and then life.  At 31 I had ballooned up to 342 pounds, and I was starting to experience not only occasional chest pains but also high triglycerides, low sperm motility, and a probable 10 more years left to live.  And then enough was enough.

Married to my best friend, live in Appalachian Ohio, have a view of woods out my back windows but loud cars and motorcycles racing down my street out front, on their way to a state park. It's partly peaceful. I walk to work, a state university where I teach writing, which sounds boring but isn't.   I love this scene in Woody Allen’s wacky movie “Sleeper” where two doctors of the future are talking about their just-thawed patient:  “He requested something called wheat germ, organic honey and tiger’s milk.” “Oh yes. Those were the charmed substances that some years ago were felt to contain life-preserving properties.” “You mean there was no deep fat? No steak, or cream pies, or hot fudge?” “Those were thought to be unhealthy, precisely the opposite of what we now know to be true.”   Okay, it also includes smoking, and I do like organic, raw honey. But the rest is pretty much dead on. ☺  I know that low-fat is a myth that has made many people sick. I eat mostly food I cook myself, and love butter (Kerrygold: mmmmm).

I was one of those lucky types, could eat anything, no real exercise  and still looked fit.  Then in my 30s that all changed.  I started to gain weight.  Not all at once, but it was a slow progression, enough that I didn't really notice, at first.  But then I started paying attention but still didn't really want to change my eating habits or anything really.    My wife joined a gym with a friend and still I didn't want to go.  I was happy to sit at home and use the time that she was out to catch up on xbox time.  Tania finally convinced me to join her one night on the treadmill.  It was there that I realized just how out of shape I had become.    So began our fitness journey.  What started out a few years ago as a short walk on the treadmill to keep my wife happy turned into a bit of a fitness obsession.  I've dropped over 50 lbs in total.   About 25lbs since being on MFP. I've regained about 10lbs of that.  I hit the gym and lift heavy shit at least 5 times a week and leave my car parked at home as much as possible and bike wherever I can.  We quit smoking 3 years ago, and did our first Warrior Dash in 2013  as well as BadAssDash.  I'm looking forward to doing Tough Mudder on August 16, 2015 in Toronto.  That is my new goal.

7628,Reneeinvic,30.0,Female,"Portland, VI",Portland,VI,The freedom of taking responsibility ,"I was studying to be a fitness instructor, fit, healthy, happy and confident, I was struck with Chronic Fatigue and later diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome. It took me three years to work out my 'new' body, living with day-to-day pain and restriction. I seemed to have got it under control fairly well, got back into the gym and pool and was feeling fantastic. Then a bad accident - left me with 4 slipped discs in my spine and a relapse with my condition(s).   I will never let these issues define who I am - not in my fitness world and not in my personal world. It took so much from me but also helped me grow as a person. As a result, I started making better choices and tried different methods to get where I wanted to be.   I have a son. My son was a twin, unfortunately he did not make it. My son was born with a load of health issues. He had cardiac arrest three times and will need a kidney transplant when he is about 8-10.  I spent such a large part of his life sitting next to him in hospital, that I can't begin to tell you what this did to my mental and physical health. My whole world stopped and I was jolted into a world of life or death. Lack of sleep, stress, grabbing food once a day and sadness took it's toll on my appearance and my soul.  My son, Austin Jack is six years old now and is having full-on renal failure as of a year ago. He is a happy boy, strong and resilient. He has trouble keeping up with other children and becomes fatigued easily - besides that and being a bit pale you'd never think he was 2% off going onto dialysis. My son is peg fed (a hole in his stomach which we feed food through while he sleeps).. So I still have broken sleep as you would from a newborn and he is incontinent. I know how close we've come to not having him here at all, so I feel very lucky!  We still have stints in hospital and he is still living with only 12% Kidney function and half a kidney left which is failing. He is amazing and certainly someone I look up to and admire, strongest person I've ever met.  The second strongest person in my life is my partner. He is a competitive powerlifter, and you'd assume I meant physical strength, but I mean mental as well as physical. He has had to endure so much - from dating and loving a damaged women to looking after his sick son. He has a grounded aggression and is a humble man whom I take much strength and positivity from.   We own and run a Strength Training Gym - it's primarily run by my partner, so I'd like to get strong enough and well enough to train people myself :-) I'm looking at training those who suffer from chronic pain as I know what it is like and training is a little different when you're recovering or dealing with ongoing pain.  So, here I am! I'm here and I'm going to make some noise! Show my son that illness/injuries and lifes' hurdles, do not define who you are or what you can achieve, a challenge will make you the best version of yourself if you let it :-)  I'm currently doing a CFS recovery programme in Melbourne, it has been a little challenging as you're suppose to put yourself first in order to recover and as you can imagine, myself has been on the backburner for the last 7 years. I'm currently seeing lots of positive changes and have not had a relapse that has lasted more than 4 days since I started!","It's a strong possibility that I'm going to be a donor for my son.

Not perfect stories, but real life everyday ..... 2 steps forward and 1 step back ..... as I am trying to not be perfect, but real and demonstrate improvement.   I started at 240 pounds in October of 2014. Joined mfp and got set up for 1,200 calories a day because I wanted to lose 2 pounds a week. Lol. It was awful, I was cold, lethargic, starving, and in a total brain fog. I was barely functional. I kept reading the forums and seeing all the people who were doing 1,200 calories and their words of encouragement and figured I'd eventually adapt. I didn't. Thankfully I read about BMR and TDEE and decided to bravely increase my calories by 200 to 1,400. That was a lot better. I was still awfully hungry and tired and cold, but my brain could function better. AND I dropped pounds as soon as I increased calories (that was unexpected). So I was still losing steadily and decided to increase to 1,600. Again I lost weight when I increased my calories...and felt soooo much better!  I was so scared every time I increased. Afraid I'd give up all my progress, but it didn't happen.   I found the Eat More 2 Weigh Less group and read their boards for encouragement. I still had trouble figuring out all their formulas and math. But I had the basic theory down which was most important:  TDEE is your maintenance, BMR is the number of calories you should NEVER eat below (it's what you need just to lay in bed breathing all day for your body to function). So if you eat somewhere in the middle of your TDEE and your BMR, you're doing great and will lose weight.   I kind of wanted to test the theory of seeing how HIGH calories I could eat before I started gaining weight. Anyway at some point I increased to 1,800 and was still slowly dropping pounds. It was great. Between October-March I lost 30 pounds. Then I increased to 2,000 and we got out tax refund back and we went on a going out to eat spree. I plateaued and stopped losing weight. And I think a combination of being embarrassed about my terrible diet (I am going to write a book someday called ""How to Eat at Restaurants and Drive Thrus and lose 50 pounds!"") and between being bored entering everything into mfp, and a giant pig out on Easter, and being sad the scale wasn't budging, I stopped entering my diary and just fell off the wagon at that point!   So very long story short, I left for 6 months and I am back now! I gained back HALF of the 30 pounds I lost. (Honestly considering I eat a lot of fast food and cheeseburgers, that's a gain of about 2.5 pounds a month. Really could've been worse!) so um starting out at 225 now.   And just for kicks, I'm going to start HIGH calorie (just below my TDEE) and see how it goes. I'll adjust my calories down accordingly. 2,100 calories seems like a ton considering I'm not working out right now, but I was probably eating almost double that before I begin back on October 18th.   Thank you to my old friends who didn't drop me while I was gone! I missed you and wow so many of you are doing great, so inspiring!!

It's hard when not everyone in the family is eating the same but with the support of one of my daughters, I am hoping to lose enough weight to feel better again.  My husband is a larger man and loves me the way I am. I find it hard to watch what I eat but my body is not happy with the way it is. It's starting to hurt which makes it time to do something, again.

Stop drinking Caffeine & Artificial sweeteners and drink 1 to 2 gallons of water a day(have to build up to this obviously)  2. Don't ever deprive yourself of something you want, just plan it into your day as best you can, even if that means going on a walk at lunch or after work  3.

Wake Up!","I am a wife to a fantastic husband, have two beautiful daughters (13 and 20), a 2 year old grandson and a few fur kids.  I work full time, volunteer and work with youth 12-18 part-time.  So you would think that being this busy I would be twiggy, but not so much.  I love weight training and strength training but never seem to have the time for me, but that has changed now!  On the 20th of Jan 2015, I had a doctor's appointment with the results of my bloodwork. (I went in the week before because I was ill for two weeks, and prior to this I would get every cold/flu/bug going) I am a type 2 diabetic and my numbers were in the 19 and 21 range, (A1C came back at a 9.2 and fasting was a 14.2), cholesteral was slightly elevated, and my liver function was coming back that fat deposits were on it and I carry my weight in my midsection so that was squeezing down on the liver as well. I am on meds for diabetes, low dose meds now for cholesteral, and low dose meds for blood pressure, all this and I am only 43. She told me that if I continued on with numbers like I was getting that I could lose the liver, limbs, eye sight or worse death. Time for agressive action and I got pissed! some people need a minor heart attack to have a wake up call, but this was my wake up call and in time for me to make drastic changes before I ended up in a worse state that I was going in to. Sure I went home that day and I cried, and cried, and got mad and cried some more. Then I got motivated! This time I got motivated for me! I have tried losing weight for everyone else, abusive ex husband, mother, friends but this time it is for me and my family is the gift!   On January 21st I made changes. I talked to a man at work that he and his wife have lost loads of weight. He gave me some meal ideas like my new favourite breakfast which I call a super cereal and other great tips like using  My Fitness Pal, which I use faithfully now. I changed the way I eat, not a diet because they dont work, but a change in lifestyle eating. I am not starving myself I am just eating healthier and watching the types of food I am eating. I love the taste of food so now I have been doing lots of research to eat healthier without comprimising the taste of our meals. It helps to have a very supportive family as well!   I started acupuncture on the 24th of Jan and Apple Cider Vinegar as prescribed by my acupuncturist, I started kettlebell on Mondays and TRX Tuesdays and Fridays, more walking with my husband for stress relief; and since 21 Jan - my fasting blood sugars are now down to 10 and 9 (yes I know it needs to be under 7 but hell it has only been two weeks and 10 points down is awesome), I have lost 8 pounds and 3.5 inches so far and counting. AND I have not been sick since, more energy and I feel great. If this is how I am feeling in 2 weeks I cannot wait to see how I feel in 2 months.   I had a total weight loss goal of 67.5 pounds which is now down to 59lbs, but I have been making small goals for myself. I started at 227.5 lbs and my first goal was to get under 220, now at 219.5 my next goal is under 215, then 210, then 205 and then under 200. In addition to weight loss, another goal is to come of the meds for blood pressure, cholesteral and even diabetes meds or at least smaller doses for diabetes.My weight battle started when I had my first daughter (who is now 20) and instead of looking at it as a battle I am looking at it as a lifestyle change with the added benefit of weight loss and feeling my best. Making it a lifestyle change instead of a diet will make it easier to sustain because then it becomes a habit.","All of my health issues are weight induced, so get rid of the weight get rid of the issues and start living life again! It took a while to get to the weight I am now so I know it is going to be a journey to get where I want to be, but my life is worth it and watching my girls grow up and my grandson grow up, and growing old with hubby is worth it!   Time to start living!!!!",quality of life; energy; I want to live!,21

I most likely won't friend you unless you send me a note letting me know why you want to be friends. Thanks!*  I'm a stay-at-home mom of an awesome 7 year old girl and I have a supportive, loving husband. I was always the lean, pointy child until puberty hit (and my love of reading outweighed my love of running) and I then found myself in the realm of chubby. I was raised in a family that encouraged healthy eating, but very little exercise so it wasn't until about 8 years ago that I ever really went to a gym with any regularity. However, soon after starting to exercise regularly, my husband and I moved to a new state and I got pregnant. Since then, I've tried to keep fitness and healthy eating as a priority, but I'm an all or nothing kind of person so I'll be ""on"" for 6 months, have fantastic results then slowly fade out and gain it all back.   This time I am finished with that cycle. I'm tired of lugging around the extra weight, feeling self-conscious, eating in secret, and just feeling crummy in general. I found a new gym, I have a trainer to help me, I will log in here every day, and I will be proud of myself!   I love to read, knit, and cook. I read pretty much anything, but I love sci-fi, horror, mysteries, and quirky novels the most. I mostly knit socks, little sweaters for my daughter, and shawls. I cook a lot and enjoy making things from scratch. I try to eat real food as much as I can and avoid packaged, chemical-filled food as much as I can.

I've always been health and weight conscious, but I'm feeling the need to step it up lately.  The pounds sneak up on me really quickly now.    I started dieting (if you call paying attention to what you put in your mouth dieting) when I was about 16 or 17.  Mostly all I paid attention to back then was fat intake.  Cutting back on fat helped me lose a ton of weight back in the day, and I've done it successfully several times since.  I'm eager to see how watching calories, protein, AND fat affects my weight.  In May I started on the depo-provera shot, which has turned my stomach into a bottomless pit.  I'm hoping that particular side effect eventually wears off.  In the meantime, MFP will remind me that I actually HAVE eaten, even though it doesn't feel like it.  Due to one of the shot's more unfortunate side effects, I also have to pay closer attention to my calcium intake (I take a multivitamin and a separate calcium supplement).  I was so elated to find out that MFP lets you track whatever nutrients you want.  MFP is also a big help in the exercise department.  I had terrible asthma as a kid, and still suffer the occasional bout of it during respiratory infections.  I wasn't able to play sports at all.  Now that I've mostly grown out of it, running is my favorite exercise.  I used to love using ellipticals and arc trainers, but running outside just feels so much better.  The real reason I joined MFP is organization.  I can access this website from work (or anywhere else, for that matter), and that makes it a lot easier than carrying around a notebook.  I love how quick and easy it is.","To look good naked, of course!  I feel better about myself when I've got my diet and exercise routine under control.  I sleep better when I'm active and on a healthy diet.  I want to be able to run and play outside with my nephews when they're old enough to do so, and I want to be fit enough to give them a run for their money even when they're in middle and high school.  I want to reach my goal and maintain it for life.

I've been overweight since the age of about 8.  I remained heavy throughout high school, but once I got to college I decided I needed to make a change.  That's why I'm here!  I was 209 pounds at my highest, but got down to about 170 by the time I graduated college.  I knew that I wanted to continue losing weight -- not just to look good, but to feel good too.  Then, I met my boyfriend in the beginning of 2013 and I weighed around 155.  He was happy with me the way I was when we met, but he knew how important it was for me to continue losing.  Since then, I've lost about another 20 pounds.  He's been very supportive of my weight loss and encourages me to reach my goals.  As mentioned, I'm about ten pounds away from my goal weight.  However, this has been the biggest struggle for me so far.  In the beginning I was able to lose weight fairly quickly, but now I'm lucky if I lose half a pounds a week.  I'm striving to make it to the end by eating healthy foods, meeting my daily macros, and hitting the gym more.

I have never really been ashamed of myself, until today. I choose to use the word ""fat"" instead of ""overweight"" because I'm trying to motivate myself and help my self realize that this is not okay. I have used excuse after excuse to justify why I am home this fat. The truth is, I'm an unmotivated and lazy person who has to take responsibility for his own actions. With that being said, today I am officially making a lifestyle change. I'm giving up pop, I'm giving up junk food, and I'm going to start walking every day like I used to. While another there those of you think I should join a gym, the truth is I really cannot afford the cost of the gym, and I get very discouraged when I cannot figure out how to work the machines and all the other things that go with the gym. Therefore I will be walking at least 3 miles every day. I've done this before. It worked for me before. I would like to ask that my Facebook friends help me be accountable. Therefore, every Friday I will be responsible for posting my weight on Facebook. Each day, I will also have a food diary that I will keep on another website and will post it here on Facebook. You are more than welcome to read it, comment on it and call me out when you see me slipping.  I have to do this for myself, my health, and my family. Please understand that I am not ridiculing myself, I am not putting myself down, and I'm not trying to get pity from other people. I am tired of being fat. I'm tired of being lazy. I'm tired of not having any energy. I'm tired of not having any clothes that fit. Frankly, I'm embarrassed about the way I look. I'm embarrassed about how I have allowed myself to get here and I'm really ashamed of not taking care of myself overall.  So, please go with me on this journey. If I fail to post my food diary every day, let me know about it. If I fail to walk every day, let me know about it. But, when you see that I'm doing something good, let me know also. Help motivate me by encouraging me. Help motivating me by letting me know when I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. Most of all, please pray for me while I do this. This is very important to me. I don't want to go on diet pills, I don't want to get gastric bypass surgery, I don't want to go on some insane workout routine.

If we've made a connection on the forums or in the feed of a mutual friend, I'd appreciate you informing me of that in your FR.  My viewpoint on fitness is that sure, a very high degree of fitness requires some discipline and self control, but if you're inclined to think basic health and fitness are defined by self-denial and that makes them “virtuous,” maybe take a moment to consider the philosophical implications of your values. I’d contend that for most people, healthy lifestyle choices are motivated by 50% vanity (looks) / pride (PRs!), 30% hedonism (yay this “healthy” thing feels great!), and 20% straight up fear of death. None of these are virtues, so maybe let’s stop feeling so fucking superior about making “healthy choices.”  Exercise: I'm active every day and I cross-train. Right now I'm into running, but I also regularly swim, lift modestly, do resistance cardio with a kettlebell, and I also walk a lot.   Food: I eat whatever I want but manage to my calorie target. I happen to want a lot of veggies and fruit and lean meat and dairy and beans. Also, occasional pizza, cookies, chocolate, and booze on the regular. Right now I'm targeting around 2000 calories a day.  I don't eat exercise calories from specific workouts back because my workout routine is pretty consistent, my daily calorie target takes this into account, and trying to estimate calorie burn from specific workouts is a bullshit mind-fuck of a game.   What you will see on my feed:  • Playful fury • Furious play • Swearing • YELLING • Humblebragging about calluses from my kettlebells • Balls. Made of meat. In my mouth. • ^Filthy, dirty, sexy talk about food • Cake-induced orgasms. They are natural and beautiful, why should we let the pastryarchy make us feel like we’re not supposed to enjoy them? Full-throated ecstasy to express our cakegasms, say I! • Requests for recipes or meal ideas • Requests for running insights and tips and training ideas  I actively practice no-fault FL pruning, so what you will hopefully not see on my feed:  • Un-ironic use of the word “journey” • “Like” whoring • Body shaming. Regarding other people’s bodies or your own, dammit. My loose skin is fucking EPIC yaaaaaaaay!  • Food shaming. You like the cheetos? Eat the cheetos. • Calorie shaming.

3302,heathercicle,31.0,Female,"North Canton, OH",North Canton,OH,Everything in moderation.,"I am a student and most recently, I was a self-employed tutor in New Mexico, which I would love to do again. I collect rocks. I love getting outside and experiencing nature. I like reading, painting, and playing video games. I like challenging myself to experience new things that I otherwise wouldn't imagine myself doing.  I started my weight loss journey in 2009, got serious about changing how I ate in May 2010 on http://caloriecount.about.com, then switched to MFP in Dec 2011. I love it here and it's worked wonders for me!  (Update 1/16/2015) Most of 2013 was a huge bummer to my personal life, including medical issues on my part and the passing of my mother. Since I gave myself a week-long break in April 2013 from logging, I've been struggling to get that habit back. Lesson learned: There is never a good reason to stop logging, unless I am in the hospital! During that time, I maintained my weight through most of 2013 and 2014.  I moved to Ohio from New Mexico on July 29, 2014. I wasn’t transitioning well from living with an ex to living with my best friend and her family, to now living in a new state, and have since gained about 30 lbs back. In December 2014, I really started to see how my choices were affecting my body and undoing all the work I spent so much of my life on.   (Update 2/13/2015) I just got a FitBit HR Charge and I'm loving it! It's been a great motivational tool to get me moving more on a daily basis. ________________________________ Stats: Height: 5' 2.5"" HW: 209 GW: 120-125  ________________________________ Please note:  I WILL NOT accept friend requests from anyone who is still in high school or not at least 18 years old.

I started this journey in May 2014, rejoining MFP in June and weighing in at a cool 320lb. Always been a very tall, broad guy and fairly active but since having kids, things have definitely dropped off. I moved form the UK to the US 3 years ago which hasn't helped much either. I always knew that I had to make a change and I went through the usual spurts of good health and exercise before falling on my fat ass time and time again. I tried but I couldnt get myself into the mental space I needed to make the change. I was constantly unmotivated and ate more as a result. Until one day I was playing on the floor with my kids and picked up the little one and tried to stand up. I stood up, but I was holding onto the couch, my knees hurt...it was a real effort. Enough was enough...  In 2012, I weighed about 308lb and went on a massive effort, getting down to 285lb which was great. I had a way to go, but I felt good. On the side, I am a musician in a heavy rock band and I felt fantastic on stage. Then Thanksgiving rolled around that year and everything stopped and I gained all the weight I lost and more.  Now I am back on it and I need to do it. I have three kids, a good job and the only thing in my life that I have never been satisfied with is my health and my weight. I'm getting older and I am starting to feel it a little.   My weaknesses? One is carbs. Always a killer so I am taking steps to take that away from my everyday life. Sandwiches, pasta etc... Another problem is portion size. My issue wasnt always quality of food, but quantity of food. But my biggest problem is grazing...constant munching. I run to Home Depot to get something and get to check out and grab a pack of m&m's. My wife makes cookies. I don't have one. I have 5. My boy doesn't finish his grilled cheese. Guess what? Run to 7-Eleven to grab a coffee and come out with 2 taquitos. Sucks. I hate it.   I have to stop this cycle...when I was loosing weight a couple of years ago, I was doing Kettlebell three times a week which really helped. Planning to get back on this too.

I have hit my goal of 155 just shy of a year of logging - Dec 7, 2013.  I hope to drop another 5-10 then slide into maintenance.    It does come down to logging what you eat, but it has to fit a real lifestyle.  In other words I still have chocolate and pick my sweets carefully.  Tons of veggies raw and cooked.  Just keep it up!  I have stalled and if on the third week still no loss, I then up my calories and vary them up and down for a week.  I have dropped overnight 3 lbs.

I used to be very active.  But that activity led to ACL replacement in my right knee from skiing, back surgery from running and both arms recently had cubital and carpal tunnel surgeries.  I am soon to have trigger finger tendon release.  All of this has been associated with my CRPS.   I acquired RSD/CRPS and am in pain almost constantly in my right arm.  It needs to go into remission.  I have to be determined to improve my life situation.  I have been going to physical therapy since July of 2010.

9727,wmpottsjr,61.0,Male,"Cleveland, OH",Cleveland,OH,Diary of an unhealthy fat guy......,"Hi Glad to meet you.   I have been around the horn with weight loss.  When I was younger, I weighed 240 lbs. and went on the Atkins Diet and lost 80 lbs.  Atkins was just coming out then.   Many years passed.  Then a lot of health issues happened; multiple gut surgeries, colostomy, colostomy reversal, long stint in a nursing home to rehab, discovery of severe heart issues, forced to retire and now on disability.  The end result was that I ballooned up to 342 lbs and I now live a sedentary life.  Though, I am trying to change that.     Beings as though I have congestive heart failure among other heart problems, I have to closely watch fluid intake, sodium and potassium levels.  I have to limit my sodium, but make sure that I get enough to stave off hyponatremia and get a lot of potassium, but not so much that I could kill myself.  Potassium is used to kill prisoners on death row.  If I get too dehydrated, It throws off everything.  If you drink too much water, it robs your body of electrolytes and causes weight gain in people like me. Too little water coupled with too much sugar causes constipation.  So my point is, there are a lot of health issues that require sophisticated tools for prevention.  My eating habits had slipped horribly into eating strictly convenience foods from the freezer case.  I had no energy to cook or do dishes.  So, I made everything in the microwave on a paper plate.  I even learned to fry eggs in the microwave.  I was horrible.    Well, I got so bad that I couldn't walk at the grocery store, I couldn't get my breath and I was huffing and puffing and sweating after every activity.  That is when I weighed 342 lbs and  I am only 5'8"".   They admitted me into the hospital on Sept 8, 2014 and they took almost 20 lbs of fluid off of me in 5 days.  I felt a lot better!!!  I committed to getting healthy.    I searched my nutrition books and the stores and found that the only thing I could conveniently eat that was low sodium and had good potassium levels were fruits and vegetables.  Now mind you, I hated fruits and vegetables.  So I loaded the kitchen table and fridge with them.  I ate things I never dreamed of, mangoes, papayas, pomegranates, persimmons (the fruit of the gods) and developed an extreme liking for them all.  There is nothing better when you're thirsty than a juicy tomato from the fridge or a cucumber or an orange, or a better breakfast than an avocado, banana, apple and orange.  I jokingly tell people that I eat like a gorilla now.  To be more correct, I eat very similarly to the DASH diet, a heart healthy diet.  I wrote down everything I ate and drank, weighed myself daily and measured my urine output.  I ate all that I wanted and was never ever hungry.  I watched my fluid output and only drank enough to replenish my fluids.  I took lots of medicines for my heart and water weight.  Well the pounds started to come off fast.  As I said I have lost 68 lbs and avg 0.75 lbs a day.  I found myself a phone app that graphed my daily weights.  It let me add my weights retroactively and provided a trend analysis line so that I could predict when I will reach my goal. That is fun.  I decided that I would eat this way for the rest of my life, adding a daily meat serving of course.    My doctors changed my medicine a couple times which required two more hospital stays.  I soon felt better and better and cleaned up my old dishes and started cooking again.  It became necessary to calculate my recipes and portions so Self Magazine Nutrition and My Fitness Pal fit the bill.  I found a phone app called Monitor Your Weight that analyzes weight loss and provided a trend analysis so I can predict my weight loss.  So, now I am having a lot of fun creating low-salt, high-potassium recipes and recording everything that I eat.  I invested in a kitchen scale and for no more than $18 it became another life changer.    Now armed with my heart pills, my top of the line bathroom scales, my graphing weight loss app called Monitor Your Weight, my new kitchen scales, My Fitness Pal, the Self Nutrition Data site and my recumbent exercise bike, I feel that I am in complete control.  Next step is to incorporate exercise!!!

I lost over 50 lbs between 2004 - 2007 but since 2009 have gradually regained that plus extra.  I was diagnosed diabetic in March 2014. Since then I have changed my approach to getting fit: my impetus now is to get off my meds for hypertension and diabetes completely, as well as feeling well, being active and enjoying life again.","The last time I can remember running and actually enjoying it was aged 10. I want to be enjoying running again for my half century!   I used to enjoy swimming too. That's my next challenge - getting fit enough to walk to the pool, and to swim a few laps to start.   Edit 20 May 2014 - staying with my Mum, so am using the condo pool 3x a week for an hour+ each session. It is so good swimming again. Also walking again without back pain or having to stop to get my breath. Granted it is all s-l-o-w exercise, but I feel so much fitter since starting to eat low carb high fat. The days I deviate from this I really notice the difference in my energy - high carb eating days are followed by sluggishness and low energy. Low carb high fat days, I feel on top of the world. Just got to fix my snacking habit...and do more exercise! :) I might be doing that running on my fiftieth after all! Edit 21 May 2014: Swam a mile, 64 lengths in the pool today :)  Edit 23 Nov: starting again, this time with 1800 calorie limit, plus high fat, medium protein low carb macros. Had a miserable summer once I came back to the UK, no exercise, eating out of control (but still logging - yes!) mild agoraphobia, depression and no exercise. This all changes from this week.   Edit 27 Dec 2014 - have had an excellent month and lost 7 lbs. Feeling good. Next month is a whole 30 reset. Wow. Hope I do it well.  Edit 4 March 2015 - Back in the pool! And am out and about. Going to be a good spring for me, exercise wise at any rate.  Edit 12 April 2015 - Started a new, very physical (for me) job, that involves standing, walking, moving things, stretching, lifting unwieldy things...I have sore feet, but my fitness is definitely improving. My only gripe is am too tired and footsore to go swimming. Can't wait until those feet are acclimatized, another week I hope, then it is splish splosh again, hooray!  Edit 18 Jun 2015 I have plantar fasciitis, so it will be a while before that clears up. Have also lost more than 50 lbs, yay! A few more off, and then I will attempt getting back on the bike. Freedom to spin around town then, it will be marvellous. Am feeling much more energetic on the whole, though I still have days when I can feel the blues sneaking back. Now I let myself FEEL the emotions and that seems to work, letting them out, allows me to recharge after and regain my equilibrium quickly :) Not much bingeing going on any more too. From last June, I can really see my progress, and it is awesome.  Edit 28 Oct 2015: have lost 8 inches off my hips! And 2 off my waist since last year. Super stuff! Another couple of stone and I'm back to my 2007 self.",feel fit and healthy; live my life instead of sitting at the sidelines being passive; enjoy doing all the activities I've wanted to; wear some great clothes!,9

After my second child I stepped up at work to being a primary Charge nurse, which is super stressful.  Exercise has helped me leave that at work.  Crazy to think I have been on this journey for 4 years!  5/2012- Now married for 5 years, together for 9 years total. That is awesome to me. Became a mom to little Makinzie on 5-4-12.  2/2011-My name is Amanda, I'm married to Josh for 3 years now.  I work as a RN on a Medical/Surgical floor.","1/2015- Lets’ get this started yet again.  Its not that I have stopped or fallen off the wagon, more like bumps in the road (aka-kids).  Little man Reid joined our family 5/2014 and it has taken me longer to get refocused this time around.  I again only gained 25ish pounds with the pregnancy and was back to 10lbs over pre-pregnancy weight.  My lowest was 160 before getting pregnant but I was more like 170 when I got pregnant and that’s where I am sitting now.  Time to finally reach my goal of 150.  I feel great heath wise where I am at.  But looks could use some work.  Last month I have had 4 different patients or patients family ask when I was due.  This is what has kicked started the refocus yet again.    5/2012- I was so close to getting rid of that obese label, think I was 6lbs away, when I found out I was pregnant.  During pregnancy I did not work out after 4/5 months, felt like crap.  I stopped tracking from the beginning and just went off my gut feeling on eating.  Nothing was off limits.  I only gained 25lbs during pregnancy and was back down to 10lbs over pre-pregnancy weight after Makinzie was born.  Not sure if I met the goal of being cute pregnant as no one could tell I was pregnant if they did not know me. I am excited to go clothes shopping, as I was at the point that I need to buy new clothes but did not as I was newly pregnant.  2/2011- My 25th birthday is at the end of February and I'm tired of being overweight. Well according to BMI scales I am obese and have been most of my life if not all.  Josh and I are looking to start a family and I do not want to pass on my bad habits.

I was eating terribly, 500-600 calories of chocolate and candy, in bed, every single day before I even opened my eyes in the morning, 3000-4000 calories a day, including an average of 6000mg of sodium. All of these calories went straight to my stomach and I looked disgusting.   I knew I had to get healthy and lose the stomach fat but I just couldn't do it. Then, while I was on vacation, I was wearing a tight shirt and someone asked me if I needed a training bra! As bad as that may sound, it may have saved my life. That one joke kicked me into gear and started me on the healthy path I'm on today. I do occasionally binge from time to time but I'm still eating healthier than I ever have before and on course to lose the fat I need to look good and stay healthy.","Although I have skinny arms and muscular legs, my stomach and chest are full of fat.

If you don't log in for a month don't expect to stay on my list.** Thank you!  After having lost about 70 pounds in the past few years I was involved in a car accident in July of 2014 and my fitness journey went down the tubes. I know many people who have been through much worse so it shouldn't have been that bad but I haven't been myself since.   I wasn't able to walk for a month, then on crutches / cane. Absolutely forbidden from going to the gym by my doctor  therapist for a couple of months and then when I was allowed back it was only for upper body work, nothing to do with my leg/ankle.   By October 2014 I was cleared to ride a bike for no more than half an hour / day - still no running or walking of any distances. I've been slowly trying to get back into my routine but I'm still not 100% and I have been told that I might need surgery in the new year and that I might be unable to get back to running/hiking next year either. *update: no surgery needed!*  I have been going to the gym maybe once a week lately but still walk 3- 5km / day. It's not enough to sustain the amount of food that I got used to eating when I was more active so now I am struggling in my progression.

Apart from that I'm pretty healthy (albeit unfit from a desk job for too many years). I  got a fitbit recently and was quite shocked at how little I move on a workday - doing my best to get my 10 000 steps/day now. A doctor once convinced me to try ultra low calorie diets (optifast?) and I found that it was the stupidest way to try and lose weight I could think of - no energy, so hungry I gouldn't sleep and I ended up feeling so bad that I stopped and easily put all the weight back on. Prior to that I was a pretty constant 90kg (200lb) but after that try, I could never stay a constant weight - always moving up and down with an inexorable climb up - getting to 98kg at Christmas time. About 15 years ago (just before I got married) I tried losing weight by huge exercise loads and depriving myself of everything except plain food - mostly plain bread and pasta - I briefly lost 10 kg but I have no idea how I could have on that diet. End of January I found this site and it just made sense - the easy ability to log foods, identify the big bad calories and eliminate or cut down on them, then concentrate on the good foods - who knew that a diet rich in salads and vegetables was good for you?.","2 kids in primary school who are rapidly catching up to me in athletic ability.

New goal of 66.67kg and BMI 22.5 for a total loss of 40 lbs and healthy weight of 147 lbs.","I can't fit into most of my wardrobe and had to buy new to go on holiday.; I bet my doctor I can hit a ""HEALTHY"" range BMI before Xmas; I don't like the ""me"" I see reflected in shop windows as I walk by.; My cholesterol is 6.1 and I'd like it to be 4.5 and am inspired to do it",0

For the past couple of months (end of february 2013 to middle of april 2013), I have been eating very poorly and not working out as much as I should be. My bad decisions are finally starting to catch up with me. I have to stop this weight gain and turn it into a weight loss. I previously had lost over 50 lbs, and this was supposed to be the summer that I could finally wear shorts and be confident about it. That can still happen, I just have to work hard and stay diligent.  My goal weight for the beginning of June is 128 lbs: 6 weeks to lose 10 lbs. By the beginning of July, I'd like to be about 123 lbs. I am taking a trip to New York in the middle of July, so if I could hit 121 or 120 by then, I think I'd be pretty satisfied. Ultimately, I want to be below 120 just to see if I can do it. I have a decent amount of muscle, so it would be difficult for me to lose more fat than that without also losing muscle.  As for measurements, I'd like to shed a few inches off of my waist and hit 25 in. there. I'm aiming for hips of 35-ish, and thighs (at the thickest part) of 19-20 in. The scale isn't always the best measurement of progress, so measurements are just as important as numbers.  I'm doing this for my health. The worse I eat, the worse I feel, the more I eat sugar to feel good, the fatter I get. It's a vicious cycle. I have to start holding myself accountable again for what I do. MyFitnessPal has helped me in the past, so I know I can get back to where I need to be in good time.","Six. Pack. Abs. Why not?
